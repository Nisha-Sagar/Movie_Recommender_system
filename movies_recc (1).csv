1,Spider-Man: No Way Home,Action/Adventure,"This is by far the best Spider-Man or even Marvel movie, the amount of mood swings it had just kept you invested in the movie the entire time. The fact that Tobey and Andrew came back and brought their old characters back to life is just amazing. I honestly can‚Äôt even think of a reason to dislike this movie in anyway. I do want to talk about the end though, that was the one of the saddest if not the saddest ending in the MCU (EndGame is a close 2nd) when you think about it Peter had only been dating MJ for a good 2-3 days since it relays from FFH into NWH and how they both love each other but now have been turned back into strangers is heartbreaking, also seeing Ned walk past Peter without saying hi or anything like that is soo sad. I can‚Äôt wait for this to come out on DVD, I‚Äôve already pre ordered it on Movies Anywhere.<br>Coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt like the previous two mcu spider-man movies this is by far the best live action spider-man movie ever. I went in to that cinema in hopes to see Andrew and Tobey also because the movie just look really cool but then when i left that cinema i found a new love for Toms spider-man and also found me new respect for Toms trilogy, they literally gave him everything to just take it all away from him and now i see this trilogy as Toms Spider-mans origin story. Without spoiling anything i will say this movie has given long time Spider-man fans such as myself everything they wanted MCU Spider-man to be, that means no more iron boy jr. This movie as a whole is very much fan service but its fan service done correctly, its amazing writing not bad humour and the cgi is beautiful. 

I also want to say that i now can‚Äôt wait for more Tom Holland Spider-man and i am really looking forward to the path they are taking him. Absolutely AMAZING 10/10<br>Marvel has outdone themselves. This is the quintessential MCU film to date. The layout and execution of the plot is phenomenal. Raw emotion, returning actors of immeasurable talent, the action, visual effects, and character development make this film so enjoyable. I dare say that Tom Holland has definitely become the true Spider-Man within the storyline. This film also offers such an incredible extension to past villains such as the remarkable Alfred Molina‚Äôs Doc Ock, the brilliant Willem Da foe‚Äôs Green Goblin, the ecstatic (no pun intended) Jamie Foxx‚Äôs Electro, Thomas Haden Church‚Äôs Sandman, and Rhys Ifans‚Äô Lizard. Returning cast such as Benedict Cumberbatch, Zendaya, 
Jacob Batalon, and even (spoiler alert) the previous Spider-Men Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield themselves! Overall, this is hands down the best MCU film to be released to date. Jon Watts has created something unique that can only be experienced through the glimpse of the audience.<br>Saw this #FDFS at 5am

Marvel #SpiderManNoWayHome 
Alert - If you open YouTube for reviews, you will end up seeing spoiler thumbnails   
Spider-Man<br>Best in the Spiderman line, and it takes top spot in the MCU movies.
I love Ragnarock, Black Panther, End Game, and my once favorite, Iron Man, but No Way Home is seamless. From the opening flowing realistic physics used, to the properly placed protagonistic tabloids, Aunt May, and the acceptance of responsibility that brought a memorable and meaningful resolution that leaves you feeling gifted.
No Way Home never went too far one way, nor ever left the thread of momentum.
I've seen Iron Man at least 5 times, and I will certainly have no problem watching No Way Home even more.
High replay value. <br>Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). and they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humourless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that ""my back"" joke and Norman Osborn repeating ""I'm something of a scientist myself"". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.<br>Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. Watch Spectacular Spider-Man if you wanna see a better version of a teenger superhero. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.<br>This movie showed us someone that we didn¬¥t even know his name. He was following MJ and Ned around. It was just a brown pwetty pwetty NYC boy. Thye brought back mr gween elf, tree, ewectro, octotron 3000, mr sand cheeks from spongebob. my high school project that was a lizard but went wrong and killed everyone. JJJ wasn¬¥t played by Jim Kerry from Sonic the Hedgehog. Also who thinks that MJ is attrative. Micheal Jackson of course. Also ned didn¬¥t even make out with a gacha kid. He wants to s[pend his witty litte time with the NYC play boy. Also why did mr magic hands not stop da litte spelly welly that NYC play boy made. I really loved ANdrew Garfielyyy really muchy e wuchy becausey he playe wellyed my favortite  hara ter. He playes the tere. And tom hanks returned on a late night game show. The death star showed up as spdiermam. And then mr NYC play boe just bliped put of exitance. I weally want to know whip this masked spideyboy who save me cat feam mr trae. Overall, very basett movie.<br>I'm not a fan of super-turds.  I watched this film only to see how they would bring 3 spider-turds together.  I was not disappointed at all, because  I knew deep inside this movie would suck.  I give one star for creativity.  But in my opinion, I'm tired of multi-verses, monsterverses, Marvel Universes, DC Universes, Covid_19 Universes, etc.  <br>I didn't enjoy this movie and what dialogue there was...well it was terrible.  Tom Holland may be a good actor, I've never watched anything he's in.  But the rest, holy jumpin' bat farts Batman!  The story may have been interesting were it not for the fact that it tried too hard to be emotional when it wasn't needed, and tried to hard to be lackadaisical when seriousness was needed.  Spidey loses another loved one..waaa waaaa waaaa...and the end, where he's supposed to be noble and let MJ and Ned get on with there lives?  J Jonah Jameson was right.  Spidey a liar!<br>Would rate a 3 but no one reads those

First off, the plot was so corny and throughout the whole movie it felt like it really had no value or sentimental impact. Given the fact that they could have pressed the button to get rid off all the villains but decided to ‚Äúsave‚Äù them really didn‚Äôt rest well with me. Throughout all the Spider-Man movies they are battling against them but then this one comes around me the whole story is flipped. It‚Äôs unrealistic and stupid if I‚Äôm being real. Secondly, it felt as if it was more marvel trying to pump nostalgia then anything instead of focusing on crafting a good, believe-able storyline. The OG Spider-Man‚Äôs could have been introduced in a much more impactful way. The fact that the villains sided with Peter was the tipping point for the ridiculousness. Just for them to turn their backs on him. Another stupid plot by marvel to keep the corny story running. For the rest of the movie it went downhill, with basically zero emotional impact whatsoever.  It felt as if the movie was more just a fan service then anything. The only moment that I felt the slightest emotion was when Peter would no longer be remembered by his best friends. Some of the fight scenes were cool and all and the production was on point. Willem Dafoe played the best role in the whole movie and was incredible. That‚Äôs about all I can think of for the positives. The end credits scenes were also very awesome and open up a lot of potential for another Spider-Man movie.<br>People bashed BvS and Justice League - Theatrical Cut for being a badly writter movie, and this movie has a 8.9 on IMDB??!! At best, a mediocre outing in the Spider-Man universe. Lack of action sequences, low screen time for the villain and too much time spent trying to make jokes (which were not funny), this movie doesn't even rank in the top 5 Spider-Man movies, and given there aren't that many, its sad. Not trying to give anything away, and its common knowledge at this point, SPOILER! Tobey's and Andrew's  Spiderman were a lot better in this movie. Their acting and dialogue delivery was natural and felt like spiderman, not forced like Holland's. And seriously, after so many Marvel outings and so many losses and tragedies, how can they still show him as a carefree kid! And What The Hell Happened to DON'T MESS WITH THE TIMELINES!!!!!!!!!! sad.<br>Am I the only one in the world to think this movie sucks? I know superhero movies you don't need to make more sense with it. I love superhero movies too. But put all three spider-men together? And those actors, I know you all can act but agreed to be in this movie...! They must pay you until no way to say no. How are they going to make the next one? Topping up with Alice in Wonderland? Or get superman and Batman to jump across the studio and surprise us in Spider-man 4? That'd be great. We don't need any sense around this movie anymore. I can't wait for them to make the new Spider-man. Start all over from a spider biting Peter again. And when they don't know what to make a movie anymore just put all 4 spider-men together but this time with Batman too. Name it Spider-men: No Way to Say NO.<br>after watching the spider-man no way home, in the grand omicron theatre‚Ä¶ i have come to the conclusion the world has become devoid of talent‚Ä¶ or maybe too lazy to achieve it. movies used to be an escape from reality where anything was possible. now they are nothing more than a commercialized attempt at reaching a targeted audience group with never ending political correctness and an agenda driven message. thank God for the ability to re-watch real movies of the past when the collective IQ of hollywood‚Äôs writers and producers added to more than three stars i give the popcorn i ate as i endured the demise of family entertainment.<br>Got dragged to this by friends, and was not disappointed in how bad it sucked. The film does have stellar action scenes; and I can understand that if you like Spiderman, then you will love this film. I do not care about Peter Parker, he's a goof, and not cool or alpha. I did enjoy him in small doses, as an ensemble character in the Avenger films, but he cannot hold with me to lead a film. The costume is lame, and his powers are pretty boring. Never saw the last two films and will skip the next inevitable snoozefest, epic fail,<br>I am watching the film tomorrow with a friend, this movie will suck because it has no character development. Tom Holland is going through a difficult faze for what he looks like a kid, you can't tell me a man that hasn't hit puberty yet is going to be the hero. The best spiderman till now has been Toby Maguire, he has everything and I can relate the most with him. Even though they put the best villains in the movie it doesn't mean it will be great, I want movie where everything doesn't feel like it is going to be quick.<br>What a load of rubbish  has this movie evolved in 20 years , non rational, wizard , characters  disappearing    - ok it‚Äôs super hero movie! How can it be rational? We know it‚Äôs fictional- still we loved the simplicity of spider man being just spider man, swinging around and saving people.  In my late twenties,  came the new spider man with Toby. Simple and excellent story line plus well directed.<br>Lets be honest, for a comic-book movie this has to be thee most disappointing Spiderman movie. Being a spidey fan, I and my friends saw this as the perfect opportunity for Marvel to showcase some cool stuff with the obvious introduction of the other two Spidermen but rather all we saw were unnecessary jokes stuffed in with a plot that was lame tbf. Like yo my man Strange, chill out, listen to spidey and cast your spell!! <br>Very little action/story line pretty lame for an action film!
Actor Tom Holland did not look like a 17 year old kid? At 26 and with very visual n deep Crows Feet on the sides of his eyes had me guessing he was 30! At age 26 playing a 17 year old and looking 
30 I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs another one n done Spider-Man actor!
As hinted/stated in movie the next Spider-Man will be a black actor. It‚Äôs pretty obvious after adding this proverbial nail to this spider man coffin
They don‚Äôt have n e other choice but to try n revive the hype n get people to want to go see another one! As well as it did at the box office it does not reflect the actual satisfaction of the movie buffs who actually saw it, who were both excited about seeing the movie to get out of their covid caves wanting go somewhere n also wanting to see a action packed movie that was n e thing but! Definitely a disappointment for me!<br>I'm a huge Spiderman and Marvel fan. My daughter is nuts about both as well. I took our family of 7 and of course my daughter wore her new black Spiderman shirt. The acting and effects were great but the writing was terrible. My son turned to me about an hour or so in and asked me how I liked it and told him it was the most stupid movie I have ever watched. We all loved the original spider man movies with Toby McGuire and Andy Garfield that seemed to target a general audience. Holland was great but the writing seemed to target children aged 14 and under. I think the goal or lesson of the movie was to teach goodness more than to get your adrenaline going. I won't pay to see any more Spiderman movies in the theater. We saw this coming in the previous 2 as well. All 7 of us thought it was dumbed down and at dinner afterwards another person told us they walked-out half way thru.<br>Honestly didn't really feel like a typical Spider-Man film. I don't really like Holland as spider man because he's just not spider man. It's hard to put it into words, he's to much of a child. Maguire played the best spiderman as he was original and made ""spidermanly"" in his films. While the newer spidermen have been made into complete dramas and love stories with strung out scenes that never end. <br>My review is contrary to popular belief. There were high expectations for this movie, and after careful thought, I am not satisfied with how it turned out.<br>The only good thing about this movie is all the cast. They did a good job even the plot sucks :( tbh the film was too long and there was only a few moments that I enjoyed it :( 
*warning spoilers ahead*
These are things I dislike in this movie: 
- Ant May's death seems to be the most tragic thing in this movie, but I couldn't feel the pain he had to suffer, it's not the sorrow like when Peter lost Gwen that we all remember for life
- Peter's transition from a high school kid to a freshman was not sketched clearly enough
- Dr Strange was kind of like a ..bad guy in this movie. He did not do anything wrong but surely not a cool guy like we all love him before. 
 
The scene that I remember the most? 
When Amazing spider man catched MJ (Zendaya), obviously she's not his MJ in his universe but well done for that <br>Alright, so I'll admit this movies got a lot of bad reviews and it more or less flopped at the box offices when it first came out but that doesn't mean it's total garbage. In fact I'd go one further and say that Pluto Nash is the perfect movie to watch after eating on some golden teachers, you'll begin to explore at length the intricacies of the plot as the special effects take you to the next level and beyond. I'm proud to say that I not only own a copy of this movie but that I was probably one of the few people to repeated purchase this movie when it was available on Direct TV, way, way back in the day. For this reason Pluto Nash packs a good amount of nostalgia which is something I throughly enjoy and actively look for.
     Eddie Murphys films have usually stood the test of time and with his recent reemergence back into the Hollywood spotlight you can be sure that there will be people going back to watch his ""Coming to America"" ""Life"" or even ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" movies with enjoyment, so why not make Pluto Nash one of those must see films on your list.<br>Im going to give it 3.5-4, 

Spiderman No Way Home lacked pace early on, tripping over itself at points and didn't really know the tone it was trying to envisage for half the movie. 

I think what they did well with Goblin, and Doc Ock, they failed at with Lizard and Sandman who for lack of a better phrase 'are just there'. 
Neither of them have a coherent story, logic or progression and are mainly there to bulk up the group scenes.

The Cameos where nice and their parts where very well executed.. character development was the heart of this Film, and you can tell.  Every actor wanted to be there; hero or villain, every actor wanted their character to be relatable and every actor wanted their performance to do it justice and it did... apart from Lizard and Sandman.. who 'just exist'.
i haven't mentioned Electro because there isn't really much to say... He's cool, he's understandable and you can see his logic, but he's also wasted.

What i will say is pay attention. everything in this film has been purposeful; from the words used, to the characters and how they interact. Second guess everything, and you will learn so much more ^^.

Made by people who love Spiderman, for people who love Spiderman.<br> This movie could‚Äôve been my favorite Spider-Man movie if it wasn‚Äôt for all the character derailments and plot holes. I recommend watching this, but please don‚Äôt let the hype for this movie make you think it‚Äôs some masterpiece.<br>Hard to decide between 3 or 4 stars so saying 3.5

The movie was as a whole a great movie that was entertaining. Their were however quite a few plot holes and moments that left me scratching my head, which is why i give it the lower rating..... the post credit teases pluging the next marvel movie kinda does answer some of the questions however.....

All in all its a movie that is certinly worth seeing (and seeing the other spiderman movies does certinly help fill in alot of context, especially far from home, which i feel is almost required to begin to understand).

My top marvel movie is still black panther followed by end game, would say top 10 for this spiderman......<br>Now, the reason this movie doesn‚Äôt compare to the ones I listed. This movie seems to lack logic, and feels very flat at times. There was a lot of times in this movie where i went ‚Äúthis could have definitely been sped up‚Äù or ‚ÄúOk...‚Äù. I heard Green Goblin was better then his previous movie and that he‚Äôs sooo great in this... but every villain besides Doc Ock was actually pretty bland to me personally. The heartbreaking ending... it had me heartbroken, and frustrated really. Instead of pushing a button and fixing everything we have to see Peter lose everything with MJ, Ned and all the avengers that know him etc? Thats such BS to me. It does setup an independent adult spider man movie after this though which is cool.<br>This is one of the best Spider-Man (Spiderman or Spider Man, I really don't know which to use) movies I have seen. The acting is top notch. Tom Holland and William Dafoe really shine in this movie. The action was thrilling, the CGI some of the best I have seen. 

But there is a reason for the 3 stars. Another multi-verse like Spider-Man movie came out a few years back: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse(2018). It was an amazing movie. It brought in characters we had never met before and made a good number of them compelling. There are multiple web slinging heroes, but each one gets their own little montage/explanation. Considering the number of new character, even the protagonist, Into the Spider-Verse delivered on emotional levels I was not expecting. Spider-Man: No Way Home didn't, and considering the multiverse was one of it's selling points, that's not good. <br>I suppose Marvel has set itself up for a tough time ahead as they plod on in the MCU's next phase. While I love the Spider-man movies featuring Tom Holland for its charm, humour and relatable feels, this one misses that mark and delves instead into a world of Spiderman nostalgia and yet another potentially world destroying problem created by the superheroes themselves. <br>The film itself as a concept is really cool and all, loved some parts of it, with that being said, unfortunately the movie have no pace, no momentum and no plot to hold on to, it's just things happening and ""wohooo"", so many plot holes and weird things that don't make much sense.<br>The reason Spiderman is the most popular MCU hero as reflected by not one not two but three movie trilogies has always been his idealistic, uncorrupted world view as a teenager and the relatable mistakes , naivete and teenage drama he consistently goes through. <br>Thoroughly enjoyable and extremely emotionally satisfying movie for the die-hard fans, with just enough fan service, sprinkled throughout, even if at times a little cheesy, at least those moments always serve the story. 
Casual viewers will still have a good time, thanks to the heartfelt performances of every actor in this cast populated by Oscar winners, nominees and top-shelf talent<br>Can I just say what a amazing movie this was , to have the old spider man villains back from previous spider man movies was a amazing concept and to have the other two spider man‚Äôs back as well is even better. You had a outstanding cast in this movie of course their is the amazing Tom Holland and Zendaya and also Benedict Cumberbatch and the other two spider man‚Äôs who are Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire and they were all just amazing. I also recommend if you have time to watch all of the old spider-man movies because then you will know who everyone is in this movie because I have watched all of the spider man movies and boy am I glad that I did because I just understood who everyone else was so much better.<br>I thought it was an incredible movie and I think a lot of Spider-Man fans will be super, super happy with it. I personally loved it and thought it did an awesome job at cementing the MCU‚Äôs Spider-Man as his own character; now leading him into his adult life and separating him from his reliance on mentors such as the older Avengers characters. I‚Äôm hoping this will be a stepping stone for a slightly darker Spider-Man tone, that more similar to that of the original trilogy and the Amazing films, and that Marvel as a studio along with Sony learns to blend the best elements of all franchises together in order to create the perfect on screen Spider-Man and this gave us a taste of it, especially in the manner it ended. However despite this I did have few issues, mainly in terms of pacing, references and CGI. <br>absolute amazing movie i had such a blast the theater was very hyped . it really solidified tom holland's spiderman for me , to me he is now spiderman. i cried multiple times watching this movie, seeing tobey back on the big screen as spidey really brought out the little kid that was watching spiderman 1 at 2 years old. seeing the old villains was so damn cool also everything was amazing, aunt mays death broke me i love how they concluded her character.Willem dafoe really stood out he did such a good job he has made green goblin my favorite spiderman villain.Tom is going to be spiderman for a while thank goodness . no more reboots of spiderman thankfully. i could go on and on abt this movie, its amazing<br>Nothing short of a masterpiece, I loved the plot and ascension of the story, and seeing the villains from previous movies and Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfields Spider-Man return really got me emotional and gave me an insane nostalgia rush. Its been a little over a month at the time posting this review that I watched the movie in theatres and its still buzzing news to me that we witnessed such a cinematic and grand return by these characters a lot of us grew up watching as kids, its definitely one of the MCU‚Äôs best moments and the reaction the theatres have are priceless. I do have some issues, even though the first act did nothing really bad I found the pacing to be really off, it started off really slow but it picked up after the first 10-20 minutes, CGI was a little choppy especially in the mirror dimension fight and the Sandman/Electro fight. Despite those issues I loved everything, I loved every throwback to the old movies and the memes, and I loved what they did with Tom Hollands Spider-Man and finally making him his own stand alone hero at the end, I‚Äôm insanely excited to see where things go from here for the MCU‚Äôs webhead<br>The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 IMDb rating even after being released for a while but it is as good as they say.<br>The movie is amazing as an entertainment film. It gives you nostalgia, comedy, high quality production, action and furthers the direction marvel is heading towards. The movie isn't a cinematic masterpiece nor does it have a solid storyline, but I guess considering the hype behind the third and multiverse spiderman film, it is understandable why marvel would focus on money more than story here. They gave exactly what the fans wanted, and what we usually want is to have a good time with out favourite characters. 
I do think the ratings are unusually high for this movie though, which is a bit odd but if you're having doubts about watching the film, well don't. Because its worth the watch.
But yeah, overall production is spectacular, comedy is gold, and the characters and relationships do kinda develop. The Movie ends opens up marvel to a completely new direction and it's exciting to see what comes next.<br>A well made spider man movie which is loyal to the comic elements and strong well made script along with gripping moments elevates the film to the cosmos. Finally MCU spider man has reborn as THE REAL SPIDER MAN which we all look for.
Major weaknesses are not much character development for LIZARD,SANDMAN AND ELECTRO. People who have seen TASM and SAM RAIMI'S SM trilogy like me would know them but general audience may not.
GO WITHOUT MUCH EXPECTATIONS AND HYPE YOU WOULD ENJOY IT.
BETTER HAVE A RECAP OF OLD SPIDER MAN movies and few MCU stuff before going to cinema halls.<br>the movie was great don‚Äôt get me wrong, but the movie was fairly overhyped in my opinion. Obviously due to all the previous villains, tobey and andrew. however just because they were back doesn‚Äôt mean its instantly a great film. Towards the end i got a bit disappointed at how easily the spidermen beat all the villains, who were all given their seperate movies against every spiderman and were very close of beating/killing them and were just defeated too easily . The choreography wasn‚Äôt good at all except for the end in the final battle between tom and the green goblin ( mainly due to Willem Dafoe‚Äòs brilliant acting). Also i couldn‚Äôt care less about aunt may‚Äôs death, we were never given a reason to love the character and the only time she said something good was the famous line ‚Äú With great power comes greta responsibility‚Äù ,  nothing original and was extremely forced. Finally, just a small one but how was spiderman( tobey maguire ) not in extreme pain when the green goblin stabbed him( his reaction to getting stabbed was like getting stabbed by a needle) , they literally joked about the pain he was going through but no he stayed down for a minute and got up. Overall though i have to admit it was a good movie but not that great to the point where i would want to watch it again. I just feel it was fairly overhyped because its of the nostalgia<br>The movie was good and lived up to my expectations. Toby's and Andrew's openings were great. If Miles Morales came too I would have been more awestruck. The ending though was not one of my favorites. It's just that,
why? I wish there was a better ending than everyone forgetting peter. And also very non-related: the theater served too much popcorn per container man, just why??<br>Only fours stars because the final battle (once again Marvel) too much, but lots to Love emotionally. The guest stars were all amazing. Why Marvel continue to spoil all the good work of the first two thirds of their films by having massive unnecessary CGI battles is beyond me.<br>Overall it's a good movie to watch. Loved the graphics. Although the story line doesn't seem much compelling to me. Love to see the anderw and Toby as spiderman once again. 
The movie is emotional at some points. And the post credit scene steal the show as always. Exited to see the future of mcu.<br>Great film! Very funny, nostalgic but at the same time the most emotional spidey yet! Worth the watch guys Sony and Marvel done a great job. It‚Äôs a wild ride from start to finish!<br>This was a great movie loved when all three Spiderman came into the movie. Didn't like how rushed it was.  Plot was a little off we got no back story from what happened. For example (Spoiler alert) like when electro new Peter Parker was Spiderman that didn't happen in Spiderman 2. Overall recomand watching great movie 9.5/10<br>men the movie is amazing. i never thought that marvel and sony can pull this master piece. the acting, the effect, the action sequence everything is really good. this will be a movie will mark on our heads through out the decades now.<br>Solid film. Bit OTT at times and would have liked more of a plot twist like with Mysterio from Long Way Home. Would recommend though as it was very entertaining. Beware of squealing teenagers especially when Andrew Garfield appears :)<br>It felt like the movie was a reset for the current Spider-Man. There were characters and plot lines that would be difficult for him to grow with...so reset not reboot. It was also very nostalgic with characters from previous movies being involved. I actually thought the way Into the Spiderverse handled it was more fun.<br>I would rate this movie a 2 Star tbh but 1 extra star for Toby and 1 for Andrew.
It feels like a fanmade movie with no much of any action scenes . very casual entry scenes . very straight forward and predictable storyline.
but CGI 10/10",9.5,2021
2,Malignant,Thriller/Drama,"This movie was SO BRILLIANT. I could NOT get over the plot twists, nor could I get over the music. Joseph Bishara's musical scores for this movie had me tied into this whole movie. His musical scores contain lots of haunting themes; a combination of viola and saxophone, as well as drums, making up a weird jazz ensemble. After reading a bit more about how Bishara organized the music for the movie after viewing it, I fell more in love. The use of string instruments to make the scores more haunting amazed the hell out of me while viewing this movie. As I watched this movie, I could tell that the more ""calm"" scenes used a lot of orchestral instruments, such as a trumpet, viola, saxophone, drums, and violin. The more ""intense"" scenes used a lot of electronic and faster-paced music. You can hear the crescendoes leading up to what occurs in each of the ""chase"" and ""murder"" scenes. The use of the female soprano voice to tie in the main character to each musical score she was in was also very brilliant. They even seemed to use this female soprano voice to help bring in Gabriel. <br>This is one of the best horror film I've seen ever. It's totally a different theme and way of story telling.And also such a brilliant scripting and direction. Another highlight of the movie is it can maintain it's suspense from beginning to end and can engaged the audience.Each and every scenes are really unpredictable, we can't imagine what's happening next while watching the movie. Horror scenes are very creepy and realistic that we can feel that situation.<br>Anyone that have this a one star rating...you don't know what a horror movie is, let alone what it should be. 

This was absolutely mind blowing. James Wan has produced yet again, another tale of terror with an amazing plot. The twist was unexpected, no pun intended. The action, the music, and the acting all blended together smoothly. Five stars, absolutely flawless!<br>If the acting was better especially the main doctor and side charactor doctors... Then this movie would be a masterpiece.( First time I din't even completed watching the movie due to cheap acting and funny bgms and editing.. But later I kept hope and watched the whole movie .. And I liked it a lot.). Story is excellent and James wans direction of camera angles are good as usual. It's far better that big horror movies like the Nun Conjuring3 etc..<br>The beginning of the movie is incredibly cheesy and turned me off the movie that I stopped watching it. Until about a month later I was looking for movies to watch and everyone was speaking about how great this movie was so I thought I would give it another chance. Oh my gosh this movie is so great. Watch it all the way through. There are so many twists and surprises at the end that make it so incredible. Must watch movie!! I love the creativity!!<br>I really liked this movie. The beginning made me mad. One part was predictable but It was intriguing exciting and had even humorous moments. Scary but not ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home with lights on in the daytime‚Äù scary, but it definitely had surprise moments and left open for sequel. I‚Äôd go see the sequel. The graphics and action scenes I loved most.<br>by mistake i saw this movie at night, and rest all ni8 was obviously sleepless. OMG what film, which shows love and affection has no boundaries like blood relations. climax was mind blowing twist! from the starting till the end of the movie it made me sit in edge, can't even guess what's going on... very different concept best plot, great acting.<br>If you value the way films are shot, locations/settings used, and the score/BGM, you will really appreciate this movie. I loved this movie from start to end. I'm 100% with James Wan on the direction of this movie. The cast is great and I really enjoyed the way it was shot, the retro theme music is perfect. If you like movies similar to ""It Follows"" you will love this movie.<br>Very clever and unexpected all the way through. I love that James Wan went completely against the grain in this horror and for everyone that gave this movie a bad review, you didn‚Äôt watch the movie correctly. Not to mention the filming was brilliant. If you thought this movie was bad try watching it again for what it is and not what you were expecting. This is not your typical horror film. <br>Amazing, creative, and fresh. You'll either love it or hate it. I loved it because it was so original and never came off as cheesy until the big scene at the police station. With that said I loved that scene, but it could be a reason for people to down vote this movie when in reality that a small part in an overwhelming well produced movie.<br>This movie has a nice twist, somehow‚Ä¶ it was entertaining and the acting was excellent. It‚Äôs just missing something to be believable, kinda like the action for some scenes in John wick‚Äôs movies. And it wasn‚Äôt scary. Maybe at first but later on, it was predictable. Overall, it was ok. I‚Äôve seen better<br>#MalignantMovie is a bonafide horror masterpiece from the genius bonkers mind of James Wan.Its a throwback horror mystery yet feels completely original &  delivers so many thrills & chills that the innate horror fan in me was jumping in glee throughout. Grade:A+<br>The concept was brilliant but the execution, the connection could have been better. Don't watch ONE STAR  ratings, stupid people often come in bunches. If they are so knowledgeable, ask them to make a 1 hr 30 mins horror movie . Watch the movie . I recommend it.<br>Dont listen to film critics.  You know why because all they do is compare a movie to something they like and if it's not equal to it then it must be bad.  That's called lazy! Malignant is exactly what you want in a horror movie.  Campy, gore, violence, suspense and most of all fun.<br>What a fun watch. Something that starts out as a creepy house movie turns into something completely different. Even though you figure out the issue before it's revealed it is still very twisted. It's kind of a backwards superhero movie. Totally entertaining.<br>You have to see this movie. I like horror movies but not too many of them are good. This one is a different turn, you would never guess. Very different from all other horror movies. Definitely I'm glad I watched it.<br>A retro throwback to schlock and giallo films from.the 70's and 80's. The best Dario argento film that was not directed by argento. You have gore suspense,weird music cues, atmospheric lighting ( lots of reds and blues) and a bonkers third act.  Highly enjoyable..<br>This was not a good movie, but it was damn entertaining. This movie had weird music cues and strange camera angles and cringy dialogue and I really liked it. Do not go into this expecting a supernatural horror movie like Insidious or The Conjuring, think more like Sleepaway Camp and it will be enjoyable.<br>Is this movie worth watching. Heck yes. It has its flaws and some of the close up special effects of the monster are not the best bit this movie kept me interested and entertained from beginning to end.  Would absolutely love a sequel.<br>My husband and I talked through the entire first part of the movie, having a lot of trouble staying focused and not fully understanding the plot. About halfway through, you are spoon fed answers until the climax hits you like a ton of bricks. Very strange movie, but at least it was different. We were thoroughly entertained.<br>i was expecting a movie similar to incidous or congouring. but no this is defferent in not bad way<br>It is interesting..However...I can't say this is an A class movie. It's like...B- or C+ class movie. It just feels like 80s SF movie remade with 21st centruy CGs.<br>unique and amazing cinematography, terrible music choices, and a story that hasn‚Äôt been done before. a decent experience with great gore. 3/5<br>The movie  felt like deja vu. Similar to the Thai movie Alone. Wasn't as great as expected<br>It was funny towards the end, not really scary like the trailer. Odd twist bad execution imho.<br>Could make better. Specially the overly exaggerated sound effects. Last part of the movie, saved the movie.<br>Definitely James Wan‚Äôs worst movie. It‚Äôs still enjoyable, but the ending nearly ruined the movie for me.<br>James Wan is back with another horror offering but it isn't as fun as his previous work<br>Malignant made me jump, laugh, curse, and praise. Overall‚Ä¶decent.<br>spooky very spookyspooky very spookyspooky very spookyspooky very spooky<br>The malignant movie most popular horror movie hai üò±üò±üò±<br>I love horror movies and this was pretty disappointing. I‚Äôm actually pretty confused by reviews that are raving about it because I wanted to like this movie, like I REALLY wanted to and it was just‚Ä¶ not good. Maddie Hasson did pretty good acting but beyond that it wasn‚Äôt good. Super cheesy. Bummer because I had higher hopes for this movie!<br>Decent movie story was a little odd wasnt really scary at all its was expecting this to be more demonic ghost and all not sci fi horror thing it was couldn't get fully indulged in this movie either some parts were will done few unexpected twist over all its decent and worth a watch at least once but overall most likely won't watch again well made movie just feel like the story could have been better and scarier takes a while to get into it if you can at all<br>Less than you'd expect from James Wan.  Whether it's a B-movie, or a self-aware bad movie, the point is, it's not good.  It's silly, clunky, cheesy.  Very over the top, not the subtle, atmospheric master class you'd expect from James Wan.  Very disappointed.  Is it mildly entertaining?  Eh.  Some good visuals, but overall, watch it once and never watch it again.<br>Fun to watch at home and laugh at the ridiculousness. Serious horror movie with great twists? No.<br>This movie belongs on the Syfy channel. Story, weak. Acting,weak. Effects weak. B movie all the way üòí The rest of these reviews are super generous... They must be related to someone on set. Sucks...<br>If you took away the gratuitous splashes of blood, the structure and soundtrack seem more like a Lifetime movie channel drama. Not what I have come to expect from this Director.<br>Disappointed..  The commercials creeped me out.  The movie was hokey.  Sometimes I was bored.  Other times I laughed at the cheesinness and makeup.<br>Movie started out promising. I figured out the bombshell right away. Got more ridiculous as it went on. Not worth the time it takes to watch.<br>It took two and a half hours of exposition for James Wan to set you up for one of the most visually horrifying image concepts ever, only to immediately drown the horror in the cheesiest ending of all time.<br>An idea that might have been good, if they didn't hire the most incredibly stiff, awkward, terrible community theater actors in existence. I've seen saltine crackers with more interesting personalities than literally every actor in this movie, and it doesn't help that the dialogue sounds like it was written by aliens trying to imitate human speech. Only even semi redeeming quality was that the cinematography had a few interesting moments, and even then, theyre far between.<br>Easily one of the worst, terribly written, horribly executed pieces of trash I've ever seen. It's not even good as in a ""funny bad horror movie"" type of way. The acting is ABYSMAL, the plot is able to be predicted by a 3rd grader, and how this even got past the Sci-Fi channel is beyond me. Don't waste your time, as it's more valuable doing anything else besides watching this horrible attempt at ""horror.""<br>Way too conveluded. This movie is a utter waste of time. They took a paranormal, monster, psychological thriller with a way to long of a setup, for the plot to be even more apparent. <br>The trailer and commercials said this was going to be the best scary movie out there and it was super disappointing. I am a big scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies, and I kid you not j maybe jumped once. The acting wasn‚Äôt that great and the storyline was not as good as the other movies these directors have done. If you are looking for a scary movie don‚Äôt pick this one. This is more of a silly gore movie.<br>I can‚Äôt believe James Wan attached his name to this film.  The acting was so terrible.  The plot was beyond ridiculous.  I was so excited to see this because I loved the Conjuring universe and all its movies as well as Insidious but this film wasn‚Äôt it.  It‚Äôs definitely not in the same realm of those movies.  Wan must have been bored in quarantine when he decided to make this.  Hard pass.  Big disappointment.<br>This was far and away the worst excuse for a horror movie I‚Äôve ever suffered through. It serves up a plot so over the top that you just simply lose interest. And to make it all the more insufferable they insert a John Wick style fight sequence into the mix. Just garbage from start to finish.<br>I'm not gonna give a long review here because I don't feel this movie is worth it. I'm writing this review while I'm watching. The terrible acting alone is enough of a reason to skip it but also the writing wasn't too hot either. The characters reaction to situations going on around them was asinine. I can't believe im still watching, the acting gets worse and worse but I gotta see the explanation of what Gabriel is.<br>I simply came to these comments to see how everyone reacted to this god awful movie lol I would simply tell everyone to just skip all rating above 2 stars. You‚Äôll get more joy out of the one star reviews than this 2 hour movie. LOL<br>I never thought James Wan would produce such a heaping garbage fire. I was extremely disappointed in dialogue and the general plot. With dialogue like, ""I can play the same mind games you can now"" and ""it was right in front of me all along,"" you can guarantee yourself that you will be extremely dissatisfied at the end of this movie. Good luck trying to get into college film textbooks Wan, you'll need it.<br>Literally so bad. I walked out of the theatre. I love James Wan but this wasn't it. There's no plot until probably anna hour and a half in, the acting is terrible, the little things literally don't add up and the the PARASITE.... literally so dumb it was comedic and the acting was bad. I literally sat through with a straight face the whole time, I was not scared one damn time. Anyways don't spend money or time on this.",9.4,2021
3,Red Notice,Action/Comedy,"I just wanna let you guys know that this movie is piece of masterpiece. Superb, thrilled in actions, full of twist, fun, entertainment and more expectations. It's like a mix of two movies. But very different. Graphics were so realistic. No words to say about the location . Unpredictable. To be honest 5/5 my ratings.<br>red notice is funny, entertaining, actian packed and light hearted. everything you want in an action/comedy film.I dont understand why some people do not like this movie. its just so nice and i highly recomend it to people who wants to have a good laugh<br>I just wanna let you guys know that this movie is piece of masterpiece. Superb, thrilled in actions, full of twist, fun, entertainment and more expectations. It's like a mix of two movies. But very different. Graphics were so realistic. No words to say about the location . Unpredictable. To be honest 5/5 my ratings.<br>So the 2021 critics have slated it, you know what that means don't you.....This films actually pretty damned entertaining, nice to see netflix finally leaving the politics at the door and going back to  making films for its customers to enjoy and not for that nut job 0.01% PC crowd off social media thats trying to ruin it for everybody else. I mean the Jurassic Park conversation absolutely killed me! Its just a funny buddy, hiest adventure move thats easy watching, id deff give it a chance.<br>Truly not a Dewayne Johnson fan, but this was a darn good movie. The cast was a great mix, Ryan Reynolds kept it live, Gayle Gadot was slick and sexy and Dewayne Johnson was the base that kept it together. The story was interesting  and had all the important bases covered. Funny, action packed and plenty of twists and turns. Great movie HOME RUN Dewayne Johnson!!üí™<br>I loved it!! I seriously have no idea why rotten tomatoes would‚Äôve only given at 35%. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs action packed, Ryan Reynolds is hilarious! This movie blows the doors off of the James Bond movie no Time to die. That movie sucked! It was an hour too long and Rami Malek‚Äôs character was ridiculous. Red Notice is unrealistic too like James Bond, but what Mission Impossible film is realistic either? They‚Äôre all unbelievable to a certain extent.  It‚Äôs got an awesome twist ending that I definitely didn‚Äôt see coming and it‚Äôs a great story.  Watch it! It‚Äôs fun!<br>Another splendid masterpiece from The Rock. Really good movie , lot of fun and action , all made perfect with a crazy twist at the end, just like a cherry on top of a marvelous cake. Simply marvelous. I really do recommend this movie to everyone, cause its a movie for everyone .<br>Three artifacts, Two master thieves in competition for the number one spot, and one FBI agent trying to clear his name. It's funny (because Ryan Reynolds is a comedic genius), it's got solid action (because Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) and charm (because Gal Gadot is an amazing villain with perfect comedic timing). Thoroughly entertaining and just plain fun.<br>The film was awsome... I really liked it... I watched thousands of movies in my life and i can recommend this movie because of my experience... If randeep hooda would have acted as an interpol agent in the movie then it would have been a better a lot better choice but still the movie is worth watching... ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>Indiana Jones meets National Treasure. This was one of the best films to come along in a long time. The humor and action never stopped. Watch for Ryan Reynold‚Äôs Aviation Gin‚Äôs cameo. :) The not so subtle nod to a sequel leaves us looking forward to the next one. Well done!<br>Very funny, entertaining flick!! Loved Ryan Reynolds character. Loved that there was no gore or excessive language. It was comparable to Indiana Jones in action and banter. Funny fight scenes like a Jackie Chan movie and just all around corny but fun and adventure and lots of laughs. Netflix FINALLY nailed a good action/comedy that the whole family could enjoy. FINALLY!!!<br>What a movie. Well when you think everything is over the story is simple a suspense enters. An action packed heist movie which in the beginning makes u believe gal is a vamp but in the end guess what it was. The bond of booth and so called agent hartley was amazing and entertaining. Well should not forget inspector das she played an important role to bring twists. <br>Watched Red Notice on Netflix and thought it was very clever and cute. Ryan Reynolds and The Rock were a good duo. Gal Gadot was beautiful and sexy. Some parts of the movie were unrealistic, but so are parts of Indiana Jones, Mission Impossible, etc. This movie certainly deserves watching on a Sunday afternoon for some comic relief.<br>Such a good movie but strong language every 5 minutes or so. Kids can watch this since they will probably not understand these things. The actors chosen for this movie are great choices! I'm a huge marvel fan so I loved seeing Ryan Reynolds play in this movie and loved the mention of Vin Deisel. I love this SO MUCH!<br>Just what I needed to watch on the big screen home theatre on a rainy Saturday. Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds pull it off quite well. The timing seemed a bit off but funny enough. Gal Gadot is a pleasure to watch. She fits the role of a beauty with brains perfectly.<br>I say it‚Äôs quite good movie with some twist yet expected as we cam see that coming but the scenes in the movie does not make you look away for a second and its quite entertaining to watch.. after a long time netflix give a good big budget movie and I mean c‚Äômon it is ryan reynols,dwayne johnson and gal godot‚Ä¶its like a dream movie cast come true, trust me you don‚Äôt want to miss it<br>The trio is legendary. The plot was predictibly decent and the cat and mouse thing between those three were fun to watch, each and every bit of the story is predictable still the comedic touch of ryan and rock being rock just like any other movie with the gal being entertaining Overall the movie felt like i watched almost 100 times but the trio makes it decently fun and entertaining movie!<br>Idk why exactly the so called ""experts"" dislike this film. Red Notice is an entertaining action/adventure film with characters that are fun an easy to cheer for. Is there anything groundbreaking about the film? No. It fits the mold of most in the genre. But it's fun. And sometimes that's all you need a movie to be. Solid 3 to 4 stars out of 5 in my book.<br>While the plot is beyond ridiculous, and you need to suspend your belief in reality and logic for 2 hours, this is a fun buddy movie. Ryan Reynolds is the only thing that makes this film a success and that's why I give it 4 stars.  He's simple great. Dwayne Johnson isn't bad either. Worth the watch!<br>Very engaging movie and a good way to spend an evening. We liked that it was a mixture of cheeky and action adventure - reminiscent of the Romancing the Stone series. The various ‚Äúlocations‚Äù /sets were like an travel adventure and of course Ryan R is an expert at the humorous delivery of the many layered jokes. Quite entertaining.<br>Ok, I admit it. This movie made me laugh. My wife laughed a lot too. Silly, I know. But still, everyone seemed to be having fun too, Gal Gadot, the  funny guy, and the big bald guy, and so did we.<br>It's the mordant guy and the chirpy guy. Matthau and Lemon. Will Smith and Alfonso Rubiero. Schwarzenegger and Tom Arnold. Party scene straight out of True Lies. A weird lack of freshness-of new ideas in the stunts and plot twists. They all do their job but Johnson normally plays alpha winners and he is the butt of the jokes in this one. The whole thing didn't sit right with me.<br>Loved the pacing, humor was on point, all leads were exemplary, ... most of all, a FUN watch! Red Notice is that popcorn üçø #flick that you won't regret clicking play on a Sunday afternoon!<br>Would Have rated it higher if it weren't for the ending -- This movie was alright at most, but it could have finished MUCH earlier. I was enjoying Ryan Reynolds and Dwayne's quips at each other and the humor at the wrong times.. but the ""Plot Twist"" killed it. Not only was it unoriginal, but it was plain stupid. If they had left off with her going to prison that would not only shorten the movie, but it would open a window to a potential Second Film that would make sense.<br>The film is a bit of fun. Not to be taken seriously. The three main actor's work well together. Worth a look on netflix. Would try something else in the Cinema.<br>An exceptional film. The action and suspense was absolutely thrilling, but the end was disappointing and confusing, therefore i felt the need to give three stars. The ending was not properly executed as I hoped for, and did not align with what I saw in the beginning.<br>If you are a fan of Gal Gadot then it's a must watch movie! However, the weak story line, poor execution of screen play and average quality VFX push me to put 3 out of 5 for this movie.<br>I liked the film and I like that Gal gadot and Dwayne The rock Johnson and Ryan Reynolds we‚Äôre in the film. But the thing that I didn‚Äôt like was all of the twists and turns. Don‚Äôt get me wrong but I like a couple twists and turns in a movie. But in this film it had to many twists and turns.<br>I can still work properly while watching it. It's not a movie that will pull me away from what I'm doing. Reynolds is still like Deadpool without the Mask, The Rock is still the same like every other roles he played, and Gal is still gorgeous, but wish she could play roles that doesn't really deal with how good she looks. It was okay I guess<br>Passed the time, killed some brain cells. It was never going to set the world on fire with the cast... but if your bored with some spare time, great. Bit annoying the scene with the taycan, could have been a fantastic show case of the car, but that's not what we got. Saw the plot twist coming from a miiiiiiile away.<br>The Rock literally does the same movie over and over. The swerve in this one to spice it up is that he ends up being the bad guy, in literally the very same movie he always does. He's funny, and charming and has ZERO acting range. Ryan Reynolds, plays the same wisecracking guy he does in ALL his movies. Same character as always. This is all old and dated. NOT FRESH !!! Skip it, you've seen it and will spend 90 minutes swearing you are watching every other movie you've seen it in<br>It's a waste of talent. Hearing that Dwayne Johnson, Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot are on the poster will make a blind man wanna watch the movie, but after seeing it, you've got to be disappointed. Movie is not all about running around and shooting guns, chasing art thieves or stealing ancient Egyptian artifacts, the movie has no plot or story, maybe a few twist but it's seem like a movie that started before we got to the theater, so basically we started watching it halfway<br>So much predictable. The scene where they credited as Bali doesn't look like Bali at all ü§£. And there was one dialogue in Bahasa Indonesia by interpol guy #Pintu Terbuka# it was hilarious, stiff pronounced. Gadot really can't act! However, the production company is owned by Dwayne himself, he should've had cast Emily Blunt instead Gadot.<br>This movie gets 2 stars because it has a bad title. This movie should have been called ""Golden Eggs."" The whole movie is about chasing golden eggs. But any mention of the titular ""Red Notice"" only comes at the very end of the film and those words aren't even said aloud. My number one rule for movie titles is: If the title could have been used for over a dozen other films, then it's a bad title.<br>This movie was kind of exhausting to watch. Ever wanted to see 2 hours of clich√©s? Then this is the film for you. Mildly entertaining at times. It‚Äôs disappointing to see studios continuing to waste Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, and Ryan Reynolds, in compilations of been-there-done-that scenes. There are plenty of better ways to spend $200 mil. #NetflixSellout. ‚ÄúBad Version inc‚Äù is pretty accurate.<br>Kinda fun here and there with some funny lines sprinkled throughout the screenplay, Red Notice has a lot going for it but ultimately comes off as a by-the-numbers piece of product.  The twists are predictable and the action sequences challenge credulity, quite fashionable in Hollywood these days, and I had a hard time maintaining my suspension of disbelief.  Move along folks, nothing new to see here.<br>I initially thought that the movie was fun because of the constant use of cliche scenes, but by the end they were tiresome and kinda cringe. The acting by Ryan Reynolds was good and reminded me of Riley in National Treasure. The performance by The Rock and Gal Gadot was very lackluster and honestly kind of awkward. Some fun elements and such but mostly a letdown.<br>This movie was terrible. Part has to do with the poor script, plot was good but the chemistry the cast had was garbages.ryan did an amazing job as always but why in the world did they cast Gal Godot as the main female lead. Her acting is poor to put it nicley. She is beautiful without a doubt but her acting makes me cringe. Overall will never watch a movie with her even if Ryan Reynolds is in it<br>Personally I did not like the movie I gave it 2 stars because my wife thought it was alright,me I give it one star. I guess it was a slapstick comedy not that funny. Ryan Reynolds acting was the same as always the same old shtick. The story line and writing was awful. It was hard to have no feeling for any of the characters. I really hope they don‚Äôt make a sequel. One of the worst Netflix movies I have watched<br>Do you enjoy fairly cheap looking CGI scenes? Do you prefer your dialogue to be mostly cringe worthy? What about endings, would you like them to be presented as a twist but actually be completely predictable? Well, if you‚Äôve answered yes to any of these then you‚Äôre in luck, Red Notice could be for you.   <br>tedious, dialogue felt rushed and stretched to build up character to make up for the lack of development skills. Only thing really cool was the environments and props use but that was really it. I don‚Äôt know how to appreciate it I really don‚Äôt.<br>Ryan is good as always but this movie is waste of time. If you‚Äôve seen Abbas-Mastan movies, this one is not for you. God I wish I could get my 2 hours back.<br>Worst movie, tcouldn't even watch halfway through. The scenes are so badly directed, the action is worse than worst bollywood movies, what a waste! Didnt expect this from @Netflix<br>I literally fell asleep watching this James Bond wanna be piece of work. Only good thing here is poor gal Gadot that got dragged into this terrible movie. Skip.<br>The movie sucked. It tried so hard to make people laugh that one killed it for me plus poor acting and jumping right at the context from the start with zero buildup whatsoever<br>Way to much Computer in video  game to start with it just looked cheap made there video  games that look more real I only watched  the frist  10 min in turned the move  off maybe his next movie  be better<br>This movie was boring.  I think 30 mins into it, I was about to turn it off but kept hoping it would get better‚Ä¶. Sadly that wasn‚Äôt the case and I wasted almost 2hrs of my time watching this movie.<br>Too silly to be engaging or remotely entertaining. I started watching it waiting to see if the movie comes into its own and develops into something decent but sadly it never did, so I didn't even finish it, it's that bad.<br>Most expensive? Probably they paid tons of money to the main actors. They shotted this film like a few times probs. There is no performance whatsoever in any of the actors.<br>This movie is more Bollywood than a Bollywood movie. I think for the first time, The Rock's acting sucked, it didn't seem natural. So does the movie, it was kinda giving a 'Bad-Fast-and-Furious movie vibe'.",9.5,2021
4,Tenet,Action/Sci-fi,"Nolan‚Äôs works are always thought provoking and need quite a considerable amount of quality time to contemplate the details and speculate the possibilities, but this very last movie of his requires the highest level of the audience active participation all through the movie! It ain‚Äôt no pop corn movie to vegetate in front of the telly!I myself do enjoy being mesmerized and dazzled by the complication of the story and being mentally involved in almost every scene of the movie and that‚Äôs why I had a great time watching it although unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had the chance to watch it a second time which I‚Äôm sure will be amazing as well! I guess those who come to hate it get exhausted in the middle of the way or even from the very beginning because they just can‚Äôt step forward in the same pace as Nolan‚Äôs narration. They just want some cheap superficial excitement in the form of a sci-fi movie, but the most their brains can handle is¬†Star Wars or Transformers which are pure special effects without much food for the brain!

5,The Mummy, Action/Horror,"One of me and my sister's favorite actors to watch is Tom Cruise and my sister especially loved his performance in The Outsiders, but this was something that I really enjoyed. I might not have ever seen the original Mummy movie but I don't mind, I prefer this one over the original since I really enjoy the mystery, the story, the performance of every actor and actress, the language used in Egyptian and even the very prologue of how the princess became the way she was after thousands of years. You can watch this film if you want with or without watching the original film first, but all in all I always enjoy watching this movie every time that I can. Above all else I love the mystery of it all, it catches my attention every single time.",9.2,2017
6,Suicide Squad,Action/Adventure,"Luke Rota,You see this movie as a big disappointment. Are you a movie director? I don't think so. And I'm curious what good movies you watch.From my point of view, each character looks perfect. And one more thing, the joker in this movie looks perfect. How would you like it to be? The joker is my favorite character.You criticized this movie until you had no place to write, if there was no limit to writing you would have written about three times more than you wrote now.I think it's a super good movie and it's worth watching. I highly recommend it. It's one of the best movies I've seen. Don't listen to hate comments.",9.2,2016
7,Captain Marvel,Action/Sci-fi,It‚Äôs a complex movie and a must watch if u are an avengers fan. It‚Äôs refreshing to see finally a female superhero movie among all other avengers members. The Story has been intelligently spun and is definitely engaging. Excited to see Captain Marvel as a super strong avenger member. The humour amidst all the action gives some lighter moments too. Chemistry between Capt. marvel n nick fury is charming.  Annette Benning as Dr. Lawson though played a small but robust part and surely impressed us all with her appearance. Brie Larson looks subtle n strong as Vers n Captain Marvel. She did justice to her role too. Looking forward for more female avengers movies from marvel like captain marvel 2 and black widow.,9.4,2019
8,Black Panther,Action/Adventure,"Black Panther was an outstanding and gorgeous film. Complete with unquestionable talent, beautiful visuals, and immersive and fun music. Chadwick Boseman, Rest In Peace, gave his all and played T‚ÄôChalla with vigor and style. He brought us an interesting and fan-favorite character. His co-stars all played there parts to perfection. Michael B Jordan played one of the most convincing and heartfelt villains of the MCU. Lupita Nyong‚Äôo and Danai Gurira were amazing as T‚ÄôChalla‚Äôs partners in crime throughout the movie. And Letitia Wright played a convincing role as Shuri and created a chemistry between her character and her brother that was loved by many. And there are so many more great Talents in this movie who did the movie good. The visuals and action of the movie were unprecedented and were sure to leave a mark in our memories. The music was notable as immersive with an African vibe and fun feel. An overall outstanding movie that I would highly recommend to watch.",9.4,2018
9,Doctor Strange,Action/Adventure,"I like how it is transitions after the emotional events of CA:Civil War, It gives new hope and a place for new characters. It shows how Marvel Studios can create a superhero that in different and unique way that exceeded their own limits. And the character, ugh SO AMAZING.",8.8,2016
10,Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings,Action/Fantasy,"This movie was fantastic! The camera work was incredible and never boring to watch. Visually, it was a masterpiece of color and energy. The action was the best we have had in the MCU since Spiderman took out Mysterio's drones. The final fight scene finally escaped the trope of the villain and hero having the exact same power, which was what I was expecting from the trailer going into the movie. The movie also did such an incredible job splicing in backstory at just the right moment that it was engaging and made the characters more interesting instead of distracting from the plot. There are some criticisms I have of the movie, such as the reliance on the trope of a perfectly peaceful society that gets attacked as a backstory/setting, the trope of killing off the villain right when he is at the point of redemption and could have an interesting character arc, and finally just the way that some of the jokes fell flat. But as a whole, this is undeniably the most unique and creative movie to be made this year, and it was incredible to get to watch it in theaters with the full super hero experience!",9.1,2021
11,The Matrix Resurrections,Action/Sci-fi,It was pretty bad...sure there are some long dialogs but without them many viewers would've been even more confused than what they already are...probably the same whom gave this movie pretty bad reviews calling it boring woth not enough fight scenes and calling it the worst of the franchise üôÑüòè we didn't enjoy it and to see all the easter eggs and get the whole story that I might have missed while getting my cup of coffee or a new bag of popcorn..I was glad for the movie to get over.<br><br>It was awful! please do not watch this film<br><br> Would rather have watched something else..Disgusting and time waste.. the plot didn't even make any sense!,2.4,2021
12,Eternals,Action/Fantasy,"This was actually an amazing movie. I had been putting it off because of various reviews I had heard with very contradicting opinions. However, I am so glad I did watch it because it has made its way onto my top 5 marvel movies. The action in this movie was INCREDIBLE the attention to detail was amazing and The characters were so diverse. It was good to see all the characters work together as a family dynamic. This movie was emotional fun and action packed. I would recommend this movie to anyone whether its a marvel fan or someone who is new to marvel you don't need much background marvel knowledge. And Harry's mid-credit scene was sooo good I really do hope there is an Eternals 2 because I feel like there is so much more to explore.",9.4,2021
13,Dune,Sci-fi/Adventure,"An absolute must-see movie. The CGI is impeccable, the acting phenomenal, and it is not afraid to kill off some major characters. And just an FYI, Zendaya literally has three lines in the movie, so do not expect much from her. Timoth√©e Chalamet, on the other hand, is truly gifted for his acting talent and deserves an award. Also, I HIGHLY recommend watching this movie in the theater. Try to refrain from watching Dune at home because the amazing cinematography is greatly elevated on the big screen. The complex plot of Dune is also a major strength of this movie, however, being someone who has not read the books or seen any of the old movies, I was a little lost. Make sure to watch some youtube videos explaining the backstory before watching this film; it will definitely help. Also, I went into the theater having no clue how long the movie was, so for that reason, it seemed to drag on. So just so everyone knows, this movie is 2 hours and 35 minutes long, and it really feels like more, so be prepared. Also, turns this was only part one of Dune, which I wish I would have known before watching it. But overall, this is a very well done movie, and I am excited to see part two!!! 5/5 stars",9.1,2021
14,Black Widow,Action/Adventure,Black Widow has become one of my personal favorite movies. I don't know why it is getting much fewer ratings. Maybe they were expecting more of Black Widow origin.,6,2021
15,Scream,Horror/Thriller ,"Enjoyed this movie so much I went home and watched the original scream movie right after, and caught even more similarities. I think this movie pays homage to the original in  some nostalgic ways. It is a very self aware film, which I loved. The original Scream‚Äôs purpose is about breaking the mold of common horror tropes, so having them be part of this movie too, in such a manner that they were, I found ironic and funny. The comments about ‚Äúout of touch old directors that don‚Äôt understand young audiences‚Äù- I don‚Äôt get. I‚Äôm young, I enjoyed it, the fact that you all expect a group of teens to be ‚Äúin touch with reality‚Äù is where you‚Äôre wrong lol. Yes, it probably could‚Äôve been better in some way or another, but I would gladly go see it again. I recommend this! It had some good prosthetic death scenes (‚Äùreal‚Äù blood/wounds, not that CGI junk) and I had a good time guessing ‚Äúwho done it?‚Äù ",9,2022
17,Passengers,Sci-fi/Romance,"This was a well thought out movie that captures the imagination, tears at the heart and puts morals into question. Is Jim's character weak or is it just a combination of chances with human nature for companionship wanting in  a desperate moment. What would you do? I myself maybe would have went longer before collapsing into a metal breakdown I think but since I have never been subjected to such things I can only imagine what he went through. In the end it worked out but it was luck of the draw it seems. I felt for the characters and understood their pains and dilemma's and this is the hallmark of a great story that puts you in their place. This is a must watch movie. I do not understand the hateful critics of this movie. But I digress, critics are unhappy people without a life and try to keep their jobs with some upturned nose review of a life they will never achieve. How they keep their jobs is beyond my understanding with the drivel they spout.",4.5,2016
18,The Girl on the Train,Thriller/Mystery,"Only once in a decade are movies of such class made. This one stands out for its sheer brilliance in acting, direction. You'll love the story as well..........However, if you're looking a scary movie, then please stay away....this is not for a fan of low grade nonsense picturisation. This movie will make you take sips of ecstacy, alchol and emotions. A bottle of cognac would even increase he pleasure of watching it........Its just such fabulous movie!",9,2016
19,Snowden,Thriller/Drama,"Snowden is one of my favorite films in recent modern times, and it comes to no surprise to me that the average American still does not know who Edward Snowden and that for the ones who do most of them likely think of him in a negative light due to how poorly American society had treated him when he tried to bring the issue of mass domestic spying on innocent Americans to the forefront of people's minds.  Oliver Stone, who is really not controversial but does make films that the controlling establishment really do not want the general public to focus on, is one of my favorite directors in modern times, and he does not disappoint with Snowden. It should have gotten a nomination for best picture, but the Hollywood establishment and the mass media tried to downplay its importance and how entertaing the film really was.  If you have a progresive mind and consider yourself a truth seeker and like a good drama, then you will like Snowden. But there is a lot of things that the government is doing right now that the general public would not approve of if came to light, and what we need now is for young and bold directors to follow Stone's lead and put the powers that be and the corporate-controlling establishement on the defense in films.  Time is running out.  Anyway, Snowden is an entertaining and important film to watch.  The script was lively and well written, and the actors were well casted, and despite what you may here, the writing and the casting are the two most important aspects to a great film, and great directors will naturally gravitate themselves to the better film projects. I love Joseph Gordon-Levit in this film, but the entire supporting cast was highly talented and quite strong.  I particularly enjoyed Zachary Quinto's portrayal of the real-life journalist Glenn Greenwald; that performance was an example of perfect casting.  I also became an instant fan of Rhys Ifan (pronounced Reese Iffen), a highly talented Welsh actor, by his portrayal of the sinister and cunning CIA administrator. Snowden is a five star film without any question.",9.4,2016
20,Oz,Adventure|Musical|Children|Comedy|Fantasy,"One of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 Oz episode you'll be hooked. They are right, as this is exactly what happened with me.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about Oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. This show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. Its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word.<br /><br />It is called OZ as that is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State Penitentary. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many..Aryans, Muslims, gangstas, Latinos, Christians, Italians, Irish and more....so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away.<br /><br />I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn't dare. Forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance...OZ doesn't mess around. The first episode I ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, I couldn't say I was ready for it, but as I watched more, I developed a taste for Oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. Not just violence, but injustice (crooked guards who'll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who'll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience) Watching Oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing....thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",2.2,1997
21,Scoop,Drama†,"I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer). While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2: Risk Addiction, I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love.<br /><br />This was the most I'd laughed at one of Woody's comedies in years (dare I say a decade?). While I've never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson, in this she managed to tone down her ""sexy"" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman.<br /><br />This may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than ""Devil Wears Prada"" and more interesting than ""Superman"" a great comedy to go see with friends.",9,2023
22,Boogeyman,Horror/Mystery,"Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. As for the shots with Jake: just ignore them.",2.5,2019
23,Love in the Time of Money,Romance/Drama,"Petter Mattei's ""Love in the Time of Money"" is a visually stunning film to watch. Mr. Mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. <br /><br />This being a variation on the Arthur Schnitzler's play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time New York where all these different characters meet and connect. Each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. Stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. We are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat.<br /><br />The only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. A big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter.<br /><br />The acting is good under Mr. Mattei's direction. Steve Buscemi, Rosario Dawson, Carol Kane, Michael Imperioli, Adrian Grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive.<br /><br />We wish Mr. Mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.",9.1,2002
24,Watch on the Rhine,Drama/War,"Probably my all-time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it's not preachy or boring. It just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. Paul Lukas' performance brings tears to my eyes, and Bette Davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. The kids are, as grandma says, more like ""dressed-up midgets"" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. And the mother's slow awakening to what's happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. If I had a dozen thumbs, they'd all be ""up"" for this movie.",9.2,1943
26,The Lighthouse of the Orcas,Drama/Romance,"Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film. Bad mistake. I've seen 950+ films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it's awful in almost every way: editing, pacing, storyline, 'acting,' soundtrack (the film's only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times). The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film. <br /><br />The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1-score is Harvey Keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. One for Keitel obsessives only.",4.5,2019
27,Phil the Alien,Comedy/Indie,"Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines.<br /><br />At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore.<br /><br />Its a low budget film (thats never a problem in itself), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually I just lost interest.<br /><br />I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking.<br /><br />For something similar but better try ""Brother from another planet""",9,2007
28,Far Cry,Adventure|Action|Fiction|Thriller,"So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. <br /><br />People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.<br /><br />Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. <br /><br />However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of ""SPOILER"" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven't even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.<br /><br />There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen.",9.1,2004
30,The Wrong Man,Fiction|Drama,"Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? Give this one a pass, it's like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or Aids in Africa.....",2.5,1957
31,The Haunting,Drama|Horror,"Some films just simply should not be remade. This is one of them. In and of itself it is not a bad film. But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of Owen Wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke. But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it's attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.",4.5,1999
33,The Life and Times of Grizzly Adams,Drama,"I remember this film,it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74/75 my Dad took me my brother & sister to Newbury cinema in Newbury Berkshire England. I recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of Grizzly Adams actor Dan Haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies. If anyone knows where to find this on DVD etc please let me know.The cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away, would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it.",7,1974
34,Artemisia,Drama/Romance,"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.",9,1997
38,Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story,Musical/Short,"The Karen Carpenter Story shows a little more about singer Karen Carpenter's complex life. Though it fails in giving accurate facts, and details.<br /><br />Cynthia Gibb (portrays Karen) was not a fine election. She is a good actress , but plays a very naive and sort of dumb Karen Carpenter. I think that the role needed a stronger character. Someone with a stronger personality.<br /><br />Louise Fletcher role as Agnes Carpenter is terrific, she does a great job as Karen's mother.<br /><br />It has great songs, which could have been included in a soundtrack album. Unfortunately they weren't, though this movie was on the top of the ratings in USA and other several countries",9,1987
39,The Cell,Crime/Horror/Sci-Fi /Thriller,"""The Cell"" is an exotic masterpiece, a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer, but also into one of a very talented director. This is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations. This is boldness at work, pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent. This is the best movie of the year to date.<br /><br />I've read numerous complaints about this film, anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting. To negatively criticize this film is to miss the point. This movie may be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. ""The Cell"" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director Tarsem Singh that we don't want any more? Personally, I would more than welcome another movie by Tarsem, and would love to see someone try to challenge him.<br /><br />We've all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer, and yes, I do agree that the ""genre"" is a bit overworked. The 90s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick; some of them worked, but most failed. But ""The Cell"" does not blaze down the same trail, we are given a new twist, we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied.<br /><br />I like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another. Instead, she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long Twizzlers and jaunted into another entity. ""The Cell"" wants to let you ""see"" what it's all about and not ""how"" it's all about, and I guess that's what some people don't like. True, I do like explanations with my movies, but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in.<br /><br />I noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality, maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another. Nonetheless, the set design was simply astonishing. I wouldn't be surprised if this film took home a few Oscars in cinematography, best costumes, best director and the like. If it were up to me it'd at least get nominated for best picture.<br /><br />I've noticed that I've kind of been repeating myself. Not because there's nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought ""The Cell"" was. If you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye-popping feast then you are assured a good time. I guess this film was just a little too much for some people, writing it off as ""weird"" or ""crazy"". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind, so it was right down my alley. Leaving the theater, I heard one audience member say ""Whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs."" If so, I want what he was smoking.<br /><br />**** (out of 4)",9.4,2000
40,"WAR, INC.",Action/Comedy,"This film tried to be too many things all at once: stinging political satire, Hollywood blockbuster, sappy romantic comedy, family values promo... the list goes on and on. It failed miserably at all of them, but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end.<br /><br />Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.<br /><br />There is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war. But poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening. Reminds me a bit of THREE KINGS, which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern.",2.6,2008
41,Showgirls,Drama,"This movie was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was totally prepared to have a good time. I at least thought I'd be able to stand it. But, I was wrong. First, the weird looping? It was like watching ""America's Funniest Home Videos"". The damn parents. I hated them so much. The stereo-typical Latino family? I need to speak with the person responsible for this. We need to have a talk. That little girl who was always hanging on someone? I just hated her and had to mention it. Now, the final scene transcends, I must say. It's so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own. What crappy dancing. Horrible and beautiful at once.",2.5,1995
42,War Movie,Action/Mystery/Thriller,"War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich√©d dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Ren√©e Zellweger is such a film.<br /><br />Then again, calling Cold Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.<br /><br />""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Ren√©e Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.<br /><br />Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern ""lawman,"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of Northern aggression,"" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.<br /><br />Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />Make no mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",2.4,2019
43,Crossfire,Drama/Thriller/Mystery,"Taut and organically gripping, Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely ""message"" movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle.<br /><br />Bivouacked in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, beats their host (Sam Levene) to death because he happens to be Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigates with the help of Robert Mitchum, who's assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspicion falls on the second of the three (George Cooper), who has vanished. Ryan slays the third buddy (Steve Brodie) to insure his silence before Young closes in.<br /><br />Abetted by a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring Bobs. Ryan, naturally, does his prototypical Angry White Male (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance (his role, however, is not central); Young may never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first fully-fledged rendition of the smart-mouthed, vulnerable tramp, and, as a sad sack who's leeched into her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role that he makes memorable.<br /><br />The politically engaged Dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing, but it's pretty much confined to Young's reminiscence of how his Irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier (thus, incidentally, stretching chronology to the limit). At least there's no attempt to render an explanation, however glib, of why Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and...).<br /><br />Curiously, Crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it -- the novel it's based on (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) dealt with a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still Beyond The Pale. News of the Holocaust had, however, begun to emerge from the ashes of Europe, so Hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer).<br /><br />But while the change from homophobia to anti-Semitism works in general, the specifics don't fit so smoothly. The victim's chatting up a lonesome, drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd, even though (or especially since) there's a girlfriend in tow. It raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip-off to the original engine generating Ryan's murderous rage.",2.2,2023
44,Ardh Satya,Drama/Crime,"""Ardh Satya"" is one of the finest film ever made in Indian Cinema. Directed by the great director Govind Nihalani, this one is the most successful Hard Hitting Parallel Cinema which also turned out to be a Commercial Success. Even today, Ardh Satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of India.<br /><br />The film tells the Real-life Scenario of Mumbai Police of the 70s. Unlike any Police of other cities in India, Mumbai Police encompasses a Different system altogether. Govind Nihalani creates a very practical Outlay with real life approach of Mumbai Police Environment.<br /><br />Amongst various Police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of Anand Velankar, a young hot-blooded Cop coming from a poor family. His father is a harsh Police Constable. Anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's Atrocities on his mother. Anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own Job satisfaction. The film is here revolved in a Plot wherein Anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.This leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired Job-satisfaction. Resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.<br /><br />The Spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. He is aware of the system of the Metro, where the Police & Politicians are a inertly associated by far end. His compromise towards unethical practice is negative. Finally he gets suspended.<br /><br />The Direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. One of the best memorable scenes is when Anand breaks in the Underworld gangster Rama Shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. At many scenes, the film has Hair-raising moments.<br /><br />The Practical approach of Script is a major Punch. Alcoholism, Corruption, Political Influence, Courage, Deceptions all are integral part of Mumbai police even today. Those aspects are dealt brilliantly.<br /><br />Finally, the films belongs to the One man show, Om Puri portraying Anand Velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",2.8,1983
45,Templarios,History,"My first exposure to the Templarios & not a good one. I was excited to find this title among the offerings from Anchor Bay Video, which has brought us other cult classics such as ""Spider Baby"". The print quality is excellent, but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull. There's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the Templars (& set the whole thing in motion), but everything else in the movie is slow, ponderous &, ultimately, unfulfilling. Adding insult to injury: the movie was dubbed, not subtitled, as promised on the video jacket.",2.3,2000
46,Le Conseguenze dell'Amore,Drama/Thriller,"One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ""ridiculous"". The first half of the film may be described as ""slow"" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecitt√† during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita √® Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.",9.4,2004
48,Zack and Reba,Romance|Comedy,"I bought this film at Blockbuster for $3.00, because it sounded interesting (a bit Ranma-esque, with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton), because there was a cute girl in a mini-skirt on the back, and because there was a Restricted Viewing sticker on it. I thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge. I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />Having watched it, I have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker, since there is hardly any foul language, little violence, and the closest thing to nudity (Honestly! I don't usually go around hoping for it!) is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie, because no matter what, she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even the anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricatured, insincere, derivative, unoriginal, and worst of all not funny in the slightest--it would be better just to listen to Ray Stevens' ""Would Jesus Wear a Rolex on His Television Show""). This would barely qualify as PG-13 (it is Not Rated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this--as if it was pornographic. Any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of Requiem for a Dream, but they insist that Zack and Reba is worse.<br /><br />It is, but not in that way.<br /><br />In a way, this worries me--the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning. If anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides (not this one, but better ones like The Virgin Suicides), it's teenagers. If both of those movies were rated R purely because of the suicide aspect, then I have little chance of turning a story I've been writing into a PG-13 movie (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers (I think it's number 2), so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it.<br /><br />Just say no to this movie, though. 2/10.",2.3,1998
49,The Alphabet Killer,Thriller|Horror,"The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie. I've warned you.",2.3,2008
50,Don't Go in the Woods,Horror|Slasher,"Ever watched a movie that lost the plot? Well, this didn't even really have one to begin with.<br /><br />Where to begin? The achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms (that are strangely never actually heard in the house-great double glazing)? The house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away(?) or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable? Or even the beginning which suggests a spate of 20+ killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house? Or the bizarre ritual with the salt & pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction.<br /><br />Add a lead actress who can't act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty, but not in the way you hope.<br /><br />Given a following simply for being banned in the UK in the 80's (mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder) it offers nothing but curiosity value- and one classic 'daft' murder (don't worry-its telegraphed at least ten minutes before).<br /><br />After a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up. Halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe. What do they do? Slide down and run like the rest of us? No, of course not- they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon.<br /><br />It really IS only a movie as they say..",2.2,1981
51,National Treasure,Adventure/Action,"After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, ""We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it"" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, ""I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip"" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The ""reasoning"" behind each plot turn and new ""clue"" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for ""never shutting up."" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a ""Dr."" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, ""Don't you ever shut up?"" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it. Creepy....",9.1,2004
52,Any Given Sunday,sports/drama,"It had all the clich√©s of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.",4,1999
53,Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing,Melodrama/Drama,"This movie is based on the book, ""A Many Splendored Thing"" by Han Suyin and tackles issues of race relations between Asians and Whites, a topic that comes from Han's personal experiences as an Eurasian growing up in China. That background, and the beautiful Hong Kong settings, gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time.<br /><br />Other than that, the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself. The beautiful Jennifer Jones looks the part and gives a wonderful, Oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of Communism in mainland China. William Holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world. The acting is top notch, and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined.<br /><br />The cinematography really brings out fifty's Hong Kong, especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments. The ending is a real tear-jerker. Some may consider sentimental romances pass√©, but, for those who enjoy classic Hollywood love stories, this is a shining example.",9.2,1955
54,The Rage: Carrie 2,Horror/Teen,"Of all the films I have seen, this one, The Rage, has got to be one of the worst yet. The direction, LOGIC, continuity, changes in plot-script and dialog made me cry out in pain. ""How could ANYONE come up with something so crappy""? Gary Busey is know for his ""B"" movies, but this is a sure ""W"" movie. (W=waste).<br /><br />Take for example: about two dozen FBI & local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer. Inside the jeep is MA and is ""confused"" as to why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle ensues, MA being killed straight off. The cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them. The cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with Gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet/pellet. MA is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed-damn that guy is tough. Truly a miracle, not since the six-shooter held 300 bullets has there been such a miracle.",2.7,1999
56,God's Army II: States of Grace,drama,"I had heard good things about ""States of Grace"" and came in with an open mind. I thought that ""God's Army"" was okay, and I thought that maybe Dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker. The film began with some shaky acting, and I thought, ""well, maybe it will get better."" Unfortunately, it never did. The picture starts out by introducing two elders -- Mormon missionaries -- and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them. Instead, the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries (something that undeniably exists, but rarely on the level that Dutcher portrays) and it becomes almost laughable.<br /><br />Dutcher's only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience. By unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of Mormon missionaries, Dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly Mormon audience. The film in no way reflects reality. Missions are nothing like what Dutcher shows (having served a Mormon mission myself I can attest to this fact) and gang life in California certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity.<br /><br />The conclusion, which I'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all, was both unbelievable (c'mon, the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home -- and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other!) and cheesy. Next time, Dutcher, try making a movie that SOMEONE can identify with.",9.2,2005
58,Chicago,comedy/drama,"As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the best parts of the movie, a worthwhile addition compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger (easier to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much superior in the movie, which should be expected, and was indeed delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie, the new ones are quite good ones, and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has few decors. The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, but their dancing is impeccable, and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical",9,2002
60,Noah,Drama,"How this film could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I would be trying to erase this from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses got melded into Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, turns up thousands of years before he would have been born. Canaanites wandered the earth...really? What were the scriptwriters thinking? Was it just ignorance (""I remember something about Noah and animals, and Lot and Canaanites and all that stuff from Sunday School"") or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible- from Christians, Jews and Muslims, to historians, archaeologists, geologists, psychologists, linguists ...as a matter of fact, did anyone not get offended? Anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one!",2.8,2014
61,The Power and the Glory,Drama,"Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress. When Sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her.<br /><br />Similarly Tom too gets a full shock (which makes him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eve marries Tom, and presents him with a son - but it turns out to be Eve's son by Tom's son Tom Jr. (Philip Trent). The discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself.<br /><br />The film is not a total success - the action jumps at times unconvincingly. Yet it does make the business seem real (note the scene when Tom tells his Board of Directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a wealthy background, so he could bring in this type of detail. So on the whole it is a first rate film. No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.",9.1,1961
62,The Psychic,Horror/Mystery,"Average (and surprisingly tame) Fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards, but redeemed by its solid build-up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance.<br /><br />The genre's well-known weaknesses are in full gear: banal dialogue, wooden acting, illogical plot points. And the finale goes on much too long, while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say: limp affair.<br /><br />Fulci's ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing, though. Yellow clues wherever you look.<br /><br />3 out of 10 limping killers",4,1977
63,Return to the 36th Chamber,Action/Comedy,"Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung-Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s, whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood, and the protagonist Gordon Liu, the counterpart to the western's Clint Eastwood. Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest, this is ""Presented in Shaw Scope"", just like the good old days.<br /><br />This film is a simple story of good versus evil, told in 3 acts, which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era.<br /><br />Act One sets up the premise. Workers in a dye-mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot, having their wages cut by 20% by incoming manchu gangsters. They can't do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters, and their boss. At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk (one of the best comedy sequences), but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times.<br /><br />Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob. However, without real martial arts, he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple, to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly. After some slapstick moments, he finally gets accepted by the abbot (whom he impersonated!) but is disappointed at the teaching methods - kinda like Mr Miyagi's style in Karate Kid, but instead of painting fences, he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple. Nothing can keep a good man down, and he unwittingly builds strength, endurance and learns kung-fu the unorthodox way.<br /><br />Act Three is where the fight fest begins. With cheesy sound effects, each obvious non-contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment. But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here, with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners, and the use of slow-motion only to showcase stunts in different angles. You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow, with some pause in between moves, but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad-nausem in Hollywood flicks, they sure don't make fight scenes like they used to! Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday, so, if you're game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane, what are you waiting for?",9,1980
64,This Man's Navy,War/Adventure,"***SPOILERS*** All too, in real life as well as in the movies, familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun, or rifle, in their hands. The case of young and innocent, in never handling or firing a gun, Jimmy Davis, Franchot Tone, has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men, like Jimmy Davis, are forced to take up arms for their country.<br /><br />Jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the US Army but was encouraged to stay, by being belted in the mouth, by his good friend Fred P. Willis, Spencer Tracy, ended up on the front lines in France. With Jimmy's unit pinned down by a German machine gun nest he single handedly put it out of commission picking off some half dozen German soldiers from the safety of a nearby church steeple. It was when Jimmy gunned down the last surviving German, who raised his arms in surrender, that an artillery shell hit the steeple seriously wounding him.<br /><br />Recovering from his wounds at an Army hospital Jimmy fell in love with US Army volunteer nurse Rose Duffy, Gladys George. Rose was really in love with Jimmy's good friend the happy go lucky Fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her. It's when Fred was lost during the fighting on the Western Front that Rose, thinking that he was killed, fell in love and later married Jimmy. When Fred unexpectedly showed up in the French town where Jimmy, now fully recovered from his wounds, was stationed at things got very sticky for both him and Rose who had already accepted Jimmy's proposal of marriage to her!<br /><br />With WWI over and Jimmy marrying Rose left Fred, who's still in love with her, a bitter and resentful young man. It was almost by accident that Fred ran into Jimmy on the streets of New York City and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non-violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the European Western Front. Smug and sure of himself, and his ability to shoot a gun, Jimmy had become a top mobster in New York City's underworld! Not only that but as Fred later found out his wife Rose had no idea what Jimmy was really involved in with Jimmy telling her that he works as a law abiding and inoffensive insurance adjuster.<br /><br />Jimmy's life of crime came full circle when Rose, after she found out about his secret life, ratted him out to the police to prevent him from executing a ""Valentine Day"" like massacre, with his gang members dressed as cops, of his rival mobsters. While on trial Jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then, after his three year sentence is up, get his life back together. <br /><br />***SPOILER ALERT*** Hearing rumors from fellow convicts that Rose and his best friend Fred were having an affair behind his back Jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law. It's at Fred's circus, where he works as both manger and barker, that Jimmy in seeing that Rose as well as Fred were true to him that he, like at his trial, had a sudden change of heart. But the thought of going back to prison, with at least another ten years added on to his sentence, was just too much for Jimmy! It was then that Jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then tracked him down do the job, that he himself didn't have the heart to do, for him!",9.4,1945
65,The Corpse Vanishes,Horror/Sci-fi,"Bela Lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for Monogram Studios in the 1940's and The Corpse Vanishes is one of the better ones.<br /><br />Bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young. After a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides' deaths, the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards.<br /><br />You have got almost everything in this movie: the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag, a hunchback and dwarf (her sons), a thunderstorm and spooky passages in Bela's house. Bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie.<br /><br />The Corpse Vanishes is worth a look, especially for Bela Lugosi fans. Great fun.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.",2.4,1942
66,Campfire Tales,Horror/Teen,"I cannot believe I enjoyed this as much as I did. The anthology stories were better than par, but the linking story and its surprise ending hooked me.

67,Danton,Drama/Historical drama,"The 33 percent of the nations nitwits that still support W. Bush would do well to see this movie, which shows the aftermath of the French revolution and the terror of 1794 as strikingly similar to the post 9/11 socio-political landscape. Maybe then they could stop worrying about saving face and take the a**-whupping they deserve. It's really a shame that when a politician ruins the country, those who voted for him can't be denied the right to ever vote again. They've clearly shown they have no sense of character.<br /><br />What really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as Robespierre; a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can't help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism. Execution and murder. Self-defense and patriotism. His legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he's helped create. Sound like any belligerent, overprivileged, retarded Yale cheerleaders you know of? <br /><br />Wojciech Pszoniak blows the slovenly Deparidieu off the screen. As sympathetic as Robespierres plight is, it's comforting to know that shortly after the film ends he'll have his jaw shot off and be sent to the guillotine.",2.3,1983
68,The Hills Have Eyes 2,Horror/Slasher,"The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. It's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />I'd give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake. The Hills Have Eyes II is just decent entertainment, something to pass time if you're bored, and nothing else.<br /><br />4/10",2.3,2007
70,Saboteur,Thriller/Noir,"NO SPOILERS!!<br /><br />After Hitchcock's successful first American film, Rebecca based upon Daphne DuMarier's lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue, he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early British period - mistaken identity and espionage. As the U.S. settled into World War II and the large scale 'war effort' of civilians building planes, weaponry and other necessary militia, the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes. These thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good, law abiding citizens. Knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre, producer Jack Skirball approached Hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption, war-time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity. The darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven Dorothy Parker (during her brief stint in Hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in NYC) who co-authored the script were a perfect match for Hitchcock's sensibilities.<br /><br />This often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate 25 year old Barry Kane (Robert Cummings) who, while at work at a Los Angeles Airplane Factory, meets new employee Frank Frye (Norman Lloydd) and moments later is framed for committing sabotage. Fleeing the authorities who don't believe his far-fetched story he meets several characters on his way to Soda City Utah and finally New York City. These memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful 'freaks' and a popular billboard model Patricia Martin (Priscilla Lane) who, during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security, he falls madly in love with! Of course in the land of Hitchcock, Patricia, kidnapped by the supposed saboteur Barry, falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix.<br /><br />In good form for this outing, Hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies, average Joes, and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals, pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving. It's a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited, culminates in one of Hitchcock's more memorable finales. Look for incredibly life like NYC tourist attractions (all of which were recreated by art directors in Hollywood due to the war-time 'shooting ban' on public attractions). While Saboteur may not be one of Hitchcock's most well known films, it's a popular b-movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual - terrific Hitchcock villains. Remember to look for Hitchcock's cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film. Hitchcock's original cameo idea that was shot (him fighting in sign language with his 'deaf' wife) was axed by the Bureau of Standards and Practices who were afraid of offending the deaf!",2.7,1942
71,The Dresser,Drama,"I just watched The Dresser this evening, having only seen it once before, about a dozen years ago.<br /><br />It's not a ""big"" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie.<br /><br />The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespearean actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), sort of a valet, putting on a production of King Lear during the blitz of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent upon the other: Sir is almost helpless without the aid of Norman to cajole, wheedle, and bully him into getting onstage for his 227th performance of Lear. And Norman lives his life vicariously through Sir; without Sir to need him, he is nothing, or thinks he is, anyway.<br /><br />This is a character-driven film; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such, it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, only 47 years old, is completely believable as a very old, very sick, petulant, bullying, but brilliant stage actor. He hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they're taking their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser, who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer. Employer is really the wrong term to use, though. For although, technically their relationship is that of employer and employee, most of the time Sir and Norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple.<br /><br />Yes, there are others in the cast of this movie, but there is no question that the true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the marvelous script by Ronald Harwood. That is not to say that there aren't other fine performances, most notably Eileen Atkins as the long-suffering stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, old regrets, and what might have been.<br /><br />Although it doesn't get talked about these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actor nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and Best Adapted Screenplay.<br /><br />I had remembered this as being a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as completely mesmerized as I was from beginning to end. If you want to see an example of what great acting is all about, and be hugely entertained all the while, then I encourage you to see The Dresser.",9.4,1983
72,Baby Mama,Comedy/Romance,"What happened? What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast, but somewhere the movie loses it. Actually, it never really got going. There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant, then find out that she is after all, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie, other than to make it longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe try not for a pure comedy, which unfortunately it was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot.",9,2008
73,Fingersmith,Romance,"I've just watched Fingersmith, and I'm stunned to see the 8/10 average rating for the show.<br /><br />Not only was the plot was difficult to follow, but it seems character development was randomly applied.<br /><br />The actors were adequate, but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns, their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional. Once this happens, the story really falls flat and becomes tedious.<br /><br />And just in case anyone didn't see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way, this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film.<br /><br />The end scene is disappointing and phoned in, and anyone who sat back and went ""Ohhh, so they were carpet munchers all along!"", must have been out for the evening.<br /><br />Two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy, none for the rest of it...",3.2,2005
74,eXistenZ,Sci-fi/Horror,"So let's begin!)))<br /><br />The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg's movies would usually appear...<br /><br />My intention to see it was certainly JJL being one of my favourite actresses. She is as lovely as usual, this cutie!<br /><br />I would not say it was my favourite movie of hers. Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /><br />The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array. ;)<br /><br />Recommend with confidence!))))",8.9,1999
75,DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING,Horror/Mystery,"DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is one of Fulci's earlier (and honestly, in terms of story-line, better...) films - and although not the typical ""bloodbath"" that Fulci is known for - this is still a very unique and enjoyable film.<br /><br />The story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring. Some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations - either as suspects, or those ""helping"" the investigation (or in some cases both) - include the towns police force, a small-time reporter, a beautiful and rich ex-drug addict, a young priest and his mother, An old man who practices witchcraft and his female prot√©g√©, a mentally handicapped townsman, and a deaf/mute little girl. All of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns, until the actual killer is revealed...<br /><br />DON'T TORTURE A DUCKLING is neither a ""classical"" giallo or a typical Fulci gore film. Although it does contain elements of both - it is more of an old-fashioned murder mystery, with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence (although nothing nearly as strong as some of Fulci's later works). This is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end. Recommended for giallo/murder-mystery fans, or anyone looking to check out some of Fulci's non-splatter films - but don't despair, DON'T TORTURE still has more than it's fair share of violence and sleaze. Some may be put off by the subject of the child killings, and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys, which is also kind of disconcerting - but if that type of material doesn't bother you, then definitely give this one a look. 8.5/10",3.5,1972
76,Ghoulies IV,Horror/Fantasy,"Busty beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC clad, bad-ass bitch Alexandra, the faithful acolyte of Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free her master, the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success; but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon Faust, the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor, which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark.<br /><br />Now Alexandra must find a replacement gem, which isn't going to be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex-lover, police detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, wise-cracking inter-dimensional half-pints Lite and Dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home.<br /><br />In the warped movie world of Jim Wynorski, all females are big-breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this film¬ówhether she be a police captain, a curator of antiquities, or a mental patient in an asylum¬óis hot, hot, hot and wears not a lot, and it's this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of STV crap just about bearable.<br /><br />But be warned, even though the presence of semi-naked, quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier, there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal: the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful; the black humour (as the DVD blurb describes it) is about as funny as a knee to the knackers, with the comedic banter of Lite and Dark being particularly cringe-worthy; and the special effects are bargain basement, consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier.<br /><br />3/10 solely for the high bimbo quotient.",6,1994
77,Marigold,Musical/Romance,"I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I seen this movie. It didn't have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing. Salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this DVD. The music was not bad it was quite nice. Usually Indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an Indian film. The American actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series Heroes, Ali Larter. Her acting had a lot to be desired. However she did look good in the Indian dresses that she wore. All the movie had not a lot to be desired and I hope Salman does a lot better on his next movie. Thank you.",9.4,2007
78,Somebody Help Me,horror/thriller,"I'm not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies..which it is not. Even though Marques Houston did appear in ""HP3"", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Okay...so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry a film all by themselves..but to trade on the HP franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference (albeit minor) to the earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was ""hoodwinked""--into thinking that they were seeing a sequel--not a totally different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry...Kym Whitley is not funny, and could not hold a candle to the late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in the earlier films. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual diversion...I have to give this a THUMBS DOWN!! Just naming the film ""Down to the Last Minute"" would have been OK. Furthermore, the Hudlin brothers (who produced the first three movies) were not involved in the making of this film.",7.5,2007
80,Caddyshack II,Comedy/Slapstick,"Caddyshack Two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up. Robert Stack is a horrible replacement for Ted Knight and Jackie Mason, while funny just cant compete with Rodney Dangerfield. Ty Webb is funny, being the only character from the original. Most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original (Henry Wilcoxon for example) except for the hystericly funny lawyer Peter Blunt, being played by Randy Quaid. Every line he says reminds me of the originals humor, especially the scene at his office (I don't go in for law suits or motions. I find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f***ing baseball bat, make a bonfire with the chippindale,maybe roast that golden retriever (arff arff arff) then eat it. And then I'm comin' upstairs junior, and I'm grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs, and cramming your brand new BMW up your tight a**! Do we have an understanding?). Offsetting his small role however, is Dan Acroyd, who is obviously no replacement for Bill Murray. His voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny, its just stupid. Overall Caddyshack II is a good movie, but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it.",9.1,1988
81,Aftermath,Horror,"Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience. the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I haven't made up my mind if this helps or hinders it. If the film was a little grainy it might have added some ""creepiness factor"" to what was going on. I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter - but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others, are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. All this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed turd. It's not that shocking, it's not that disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it a 3 for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia (there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos ;) - the filming is good and it does have some ""gore"" (if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore...) but other than that - absolutely nothing going for this over-hyped mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - Cerda's ""sequel"" to AFTERMATH (now available as a ""double feature"" released by Unearthed films) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film, really showing what a good director Cerda really is when given the right material. Although I don't care for AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well made that I will forgive Cerda and Definitely keep an eye out for him in the future...",9.2,2021
82,Mukhsin,Drama/Romance,"I thought that Mukhsin has been wonderfully written. Its not just about entertainment. There's tonnes of subtle messages that i think Yasmin was trying to bring across. And yes, it might be confusing to some of you(especially if you didn't watch Sepet and/or Gubra for 76 times).<br /><br />I bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right? Its really ironic how the characters relate. Like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from Gubra. And the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future. <br /><br />And i absolutely love the voice-overs. Its crude yet awakeningly fresh. Like, when they took a shot of the Rumah Tumpangan Gamin signboard, then there was suddenly Mukhsin's voice saying 'Bismillahhirrahmannirrahim..' (the scene when he climbed the tree).<br /><br />It captured Malaysian's attitude(and in some mild way, sniggering at how pathetic it is) portrayed in the character. For example, even the kids can be really sharp tongued(complete with the shrill annoying voice) and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long. And how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl, when ur own life isn't sorted out. <br /><br />All i can say is, this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it. <br /><br />It kept me glued to the screen, i couldn't even take my eyes off it. Not even to make out in the cinema. Ha ha.",6,2006
83,The Greatest Game Ever Played,Drama/Sport,"I am not a golf fan by any means. On May 26 about 10:30 PM the movie started with a scene in the late 1800's. Old movies I like but not golf however, within the first scene a young boy (Harry Vardon) is awaken by the voices of men. He goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something... So , then I turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on. The movie is excellent. We then see this young boy now a man; professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood. Then we meet the true focus of the movie Francis and the decisions he makes for golf. You meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period. Then there is little Eddie Lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in Francis winning. Don't want to give away too much . I was up until 2 A.M. This is super please see the movie.",9.1,2005
85,The Cutthroat Island,Action/Adventure,"It tries to be the epic adventure of the century. And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi, Christopher Lee and John-Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B-adventure of all time. It's actually is a pretty fun, swashbuckling adventure that, even with it's flaws, captures your interest. It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it. Even if it's made in the 90s, it doesn't have a modern feel. It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had. Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I'm afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had. This on the other hand, just has the real feeling. You just can't hate it. I think it's an okay adventure movie. And I really love the soundtrack. Damn, I want the theme song.",9.2,1995
86,The Last Hard Men,Western/Action,"The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang. Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety. No they don't because Coburn has a mission of revenge. To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman.<br /><br />That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after. As he explains it to his daughter, Barbara Hershey, Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff. His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired. It's not something he's proud of, she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt.<br /><br />Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is. Heston is his usual stalwart hero, but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn. He blows everyone else off the screen when he's on. <br /><br />Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can't touch him. He knows that Heston has to make it personal then.<br /><br />Coburn's gang includes, Morgan Paull, Thalmus Rasulala, John Quade, Larry Wilcox, and Jorge Rivero. Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son-in-law to be.<br /><br />The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western. Andrew McLaglen directed it and I'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh. It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence. Of which there is a lot. <br /><br />For a little Peckinpaugh lite, The Last Hard Men is your film.",2.5,1976
87,Entrails of a Virgin,Horror/Pink,"Maybe it was the title, or the trailer (certainly not the interview on the DVD, which is with the director as he keeps saying ""hi, kids"" into the camera like a buffoon), but I had expectations for Entrails of a Virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal, bloody killings by a weird Japanese penetrator. Turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good, or bad, or whatever. There's a problem- and one can see this also in the Italian sexploitation flick Porno Holocaust, similar to this in many respects- in not having balance to the sex and violence. Too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno, and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies! And with the killing scenes, there has to be at least a little tack, and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity, in creating the creature/killer/whatever. Entrails of a Virgin has neither. It's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie, even if isn't one of the very worst ever made- it's there just for horn-dog Japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their 'other' heads.<br /><br />In this case, we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls, nothing too salacious, and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by ""A Murderer"" as he's credited. First off, the director Kazuo 'Gaira' Komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on- we get spliced in (or phoned in, take your pick) clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere. It looks like it's from another movie. Then once settled into the house, there's a 'wrestling' scene that's poorly choreographed and shot (yeah, we really need to see him 'all' there), and then on to the rape and killings. First the rape, by the photographers, who promise the girls some jobs for their time. Then the Murderer, who like D'Amato's creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial, and who for an unknown reason kills the men and/or rapes the women one by one.<br /><br />Now, the latter of those, taken by themselves, should be considered the highlights of the movie. This is like saying, however, that the cro√ªtons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad. An eye-gouging scene, a spike thrown like an Olympic event (that scene, actually, is kind of cool), and finally the entrailing of the overly sex-crazed girl, whose inconsequential name I can't remember. Even *this* becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title! On top of this, the sex scenes, which become tedious through 'Gaira' and his indulgence in long-takes-without-cutaways where everything by the Japanese censors is blurred anyway, are dubbed over by the actors (you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough, hence the need to let them 'speak' for themselves). But the overall feeling from Entrails of a Virgin is that of a lumpy one, where it's just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror (watch as the last girl left alive, the virgin of the picture, tries to stop the murderer from getting to her, which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him!) You just want it to be done with, for the 'I hate women' mantra to ease up or be rid altogether.",9.4,1986
88,Che,Biography/Drama,"The few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute Boy Scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes. When Sharif or, please God, Palance try their hand at fiery oratory, they sound like Kurtz swallowing a bug. The displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of Cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean, and a positively Vaudevillian hypothesis on how the Bay of Pigs came to pass. What does that leave us with? One comical dentistry scene; a surfeit of uppity Hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train; and, just for kicks, a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to Castro's manic and unremitting cigar-fellatio. Never trust a Medved, but even a busted clock is right twice a day: this is a HISTORICALLY awful movie.",6,2008
90,The Theory of Everything,Biography/Drama,"Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of geniuses. Watching this movie makes me feel dumb. But it's a great movie. Not highly entertaining, but very very intriguing. The movie centers around wheelchair bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein look average, and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, the galaxy, and black holes. Everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they'v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they'll write it all down. Well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours. Here is a man who despite suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen. Watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes. Awesome. You won't be the same after you see it.",9.1,2014
91,Carnal Innocence,Drama/Mystery,"The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past (the death of her childhood friend and abusive father). Tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring. Can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders? <br /><br />You really don't need to find out because, Oh My God! This was so so so so bad! I know all the Nora Roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of 10's. Then the rest of us will see an IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. But do not be fooled. The ending was predictable, the acting TERRIBLE (don't even get me started about the southern accents *y'all*) and the story was trite. Just remember....you were warned!",2.6,2011
91,Blood Surf,Horror/Thriller,"Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school play, And I've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood Surf.",2.6,2000
92,The Number 23,Drama/Mystery,"""Fate"" leads Walter Sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life, all based around the number 23. As the story unfolds in real life and fiction, Sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end.<br /><br />The Number 23 offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution. The film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential. The screenplay was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea, he just didn't know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time. The second half of the film was running low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with Phone Booth and a few other films but The Number 23 reminds me that he's still capable of making a stinker. He has the movie drenched in style but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the film at a clunky and slow pace. He switches from reality to what's actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying. The actual book in the film that's titled ""The Number 23"" is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to Carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with book, we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension. We impatiently wait for the movie to reach it's horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished.<br /><br />The acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn't even seem to be trying. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden. His narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland as was Danny Huston. Overall, The Number 23 was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills. Rating 3/10",6.5,2007
93,The Voilent Man,Western/Drama,"This is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers. It's certainly all been done before and since. But The Violent Men is something special.<br /><br />What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films. She's married to the crippled Edward G. Robinson who's the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent. No matter to Barbara, whose needs are being met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. That doesn't sit well with either Dianne Foster who is Robinson and Stanwyck's daughter, nor with Lita Milan who is Keith's Mexican girl friend.<br /><br />The infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but Glenn Ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a Civil War veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here. He's every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often. I almost expect those famous words from Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth, ""I'm a peaceable man."" Would have been very applicable in The Vioilent Men.<br /><br />The Fifties was the age of the adult western, themes were entering into horse operas that hadn't been explored before. The following year Glenn Ford would do another western, Jubal, one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component.<br /><br />There's enough traditional western stuff in The Violent Men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well.",3.2,1955
94,The Mutilation Man,horror,"Apparently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'apparently' because without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers won't have a clue what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, but unless they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real chore to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis-chordant sound, terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue, this mind-numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead (I watched the whole thing, but am well aware that I'm completely barking!).",2.8,1998
95,Jawani Diwani: A Youthful Joyride,Romance/Hindi cinema,"This movie was absolutely pathetic. A pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes. At times I felt like I was watching an episode of Beavis and Butthead. I couldn't even sit through the whole movie. Emran Hashmi disappoints, and Hrshitta Bhatt is not impressive at all. Celina Jaitley was not bad. The only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on Anu Malik and his obsession of shayaris. It was pretty hilarious. The songs ""Sini Ne"" and its remix version were really good. You can always count on Emran lip-locking and lip-synching a chartbuster. All in all, it seems Emran doesn't have a good script from the Bhatts to back him up this time.",2.7,2006
97,Basic Instinct 2,erotic thriller,"Yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.<br /><br />Sharon Stone is great in her role of Catherine Trammell as is Morrissey as Dr glass. He is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. Glass is drawn into a seductive game that Trammel uses to manipulate his mind.<br /><br />The acting was good (apart from Thewlis)<br /><br />Stone really has a talent with this role. She's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.She really impressed me(like in Casino). Morrisey was also good. He showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. Thewlis however was lame. He ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. He really sucked.<br /><br />Overall, this movie not as good the first but Stone is a hoot to watch. Just ignore Thewlis.",4,2006
99,Rosemary and Thyme,"Mystery, Drama","This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening, and every week without fail, they somehow stumble upon a murder. Because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder, right? But even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't the smart thing to do be to tell the police? You know, the people who can actually do something about it... But every week, these two fools go around, polluting evidence, committing crimes of their own, and, in some cases, causing more murders. Once they do miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted. All the evidence has been sabotaged. And you'd think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? Yay! We've solved the murder! Now like every other week, let's go and confront the murderer ourselves and, with no back-up, tell them that we know about it. There is no way we could get ourselves into any danger, is there? Rosemary and Thyme is one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.",2.2,2003
100,Monsters,Indie film/Sci-fi,"This show has to be my favorite out of all the 80's horror TV shows. Like Tales from the Darkside, also from the same creators, this show is a rare gem. If you agree with me, PLEASE sign this petition I started, to get the word out for Monsters and get it out on DVD. Here is the petition address: www.petitiononline.com/19784444/petition.html Some of my favorite episodes would have to be Glim glim, and Rain Dance. I also loved the opening intro with the monster family. That used to creep me out! One of the things I would have to ask the DVD creators to include would be the organ sound heard right before where the commercial break would be. I don't know if any of you remember that part but that's one of the main things that brings back memories to me. I mean, come on! War of the Worlds the TV series already has been released on DVD, so I say Monsters, and also Tales from the Darkside, and Friday the 13th the series should be released too! We the fans need to speak our minds! We need this awesome show on DVD so PLEASE spread the word!!!",9,2010
101,Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,Horror/Slasher,"This is going to be the most useless comment I have ever put down, but yet I must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that ""Freddy's Dead"" is. It is not only the very worst chapter of the Nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! It was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. The horrible 3-D ending and over-the-top CORNY kills are enough to drive this ""film"" into the ground. However, it doesn't stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! It's no wonder why Freddy, as always played by Robert Englund, has made two postmortem appearances. I would too if I went out like that. This is a strictly fans only movie, don't stare at our shame.",2.2,1991
102,Airport '80: The Concorde,"Disaster, Thriller","'Airport 4' is basically a slopped together mess for Universal Studios to try and work a new twist - the Concorde supersonic airliner - into their 'disaster-in-the-sky' formula.<br /><br />Bogged down with unintentional humor, the best of which is when George Kennedy sticks his hand out of Concorde's window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat-seeking missile following the aircraft's flight path, and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re-boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this one including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon, and Martha Raye as a nervous passenger. <br /><br />Not really related to the other 'Airport' films.",2.3,1979
102,Nightmare in Badham County,"Drama, Exploitation","Supposedly a ""social commentary"" on racism and prison conditions in the rural South of the 1970's, ""Nightmare"" is full of bad Southern stereotypes, complete with phoney accents. Not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most American Southerners, this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly-disguised ""babe in prison"" movie--especially in its uncut original version. Nevertheless, acting is generally above average and the late Chuck Connors, in particular, does a good job of making viewers hate him--even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes. There's also a change-of-pace role for the late Robert Reed, who appears as the lecherous warden, and Tina Louise (previously Ginger of ""Gilligan's Island"") made a rather believable sadistic prison guard. My grade: D. <br /><br />",2.3,1976
103,Prison,Horror,"Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best...but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films. The film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it's an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen. The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison's governor. Naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance.<br /><br />The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. This is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. The horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. As the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict's ghost and while it's fairly interesting, some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little. Still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down.",2.3,1987
104,The Brain,"Horror, Comedy","Insignificant and low-brained (haha!) 80's horror like there are thirteen in a dozen, yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind. The special effects are tacky, the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs! ""The Brain"" takes place in a typical quiet-American town setting, where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool-kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet. It is here that a TV-guru named Dr. Blake and his adorable pet-brain begin their quest for nation-wide mind controlling. Under the label of ""independent thinkers"", a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill! How cool is that? Now, it's up to the Meadowvale teen-rebel to save the world! The funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where Dr. Blake and his monstrous brain actually come from. There are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that's about it. Meh, who needs a background in a movie like this, really? There's not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the ""evil"" brain looks like an over-sized sock-puppet. The only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie. Director Ed Hunt and writer Barry Pearson are the same men who made ""Bloody Birthday"" (guilty pleasure of mine) and ""Plague"". Both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry. The most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great David Gale, whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in Re-Animator. A girl named Christine Kossak provides the nudity-factor and she's obviously a great talent¬Ö She has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which THIS is her ""masterpiece"". In her debut, she was credited as 'runaway model' and in ""3 men and a baby"", her character is referred to as 'one of Jack's girls'. I really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress¬Ö",9.1,1988
105,The Evil That Men Do,"Action, Thriller","Does anyone remember the alternative comedy show THE COMIC STRIP PRESENTS . One edition featured Charles Bronson ( Robbie Coltrane ) being interviewed about his new movie GLC :<br /><br />"" It's about a man , an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and I have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner "" <br /><br />"" And after GLC what next for Bronson ? "" <br /><br />"" We're using a new angle . My family don't get wiped out but I go after creeps just the same "" <br /><br />This accurately describes THE EVIL THAT MEN DO . It's a Bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn't down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained <br /><br />Bronson is a retired hit-man who isn't giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of "" The Doctor "" , not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture . It's never really explained why The Doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why The Doctor and his sister have ridiculous English accents <br /><br />As you may guess it's a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like The Doctor's sister being a lesbian so some T&A can be included <br /><br />In many ways it's like one of those nasty Chuck Norris vehicles that were being released at the same time , but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ICE COLD IN ALEX and THE GUNS OF NAVERONE two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on Sunday afternoons . Believe me this movie won't be shown until well after the watershed",2.2,1984
106,What's the Matter with Helen?,"Horror, Drama, Musical","Well, here's another terrific example of awkward 70's film-making! The rudimentary premise of ""What's the matter with Helen?"" is quite shocking and disturbing, but it's presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion! In the hands of any other movie crew, this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale, but with director Curtis Harrington (""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"") and scriptwriter Henry Farrell (""Hush¬ÖHush¬ÖSweet Charlotte"") in charge, it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres. The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific, but there's a lot more to experience, like love stories, a swinging 1930's atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap-dancing! The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique. We're literally catapulted back to the 1930's, with a sublime depiction of that era's music, religion, theatrical business and wardrobes. Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life-imprisonment for murder, Adelle (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen (Shelley Winters) flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls. Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment, as she falls in love with a local millionaire, but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia. She only listens to the ramblings of a radio-evangelist, fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies. The script, although not entirely without flaws, is well written and the film is adequately paced. There's never a dull moment in ""What's the matter with Helen"", although the singing, tap-dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot. But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters. She's downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who's about to snap any second and, especially during the last ten minutes or so, she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers, Jason Voorhees' and Michael Myers' combined! There are several terrific supportive characters who are, sadly, a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential, like Mich√©al MacLiamm√≥ir as the cocky elocution teacher, Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies' house. There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us, but particularly the set pieces and costume designs (even nominated for an Oscar!) are breathtaking.",9.1,1971
107,Not on the Lips,"Musical, Comedy","Resnais, wow! The genius who brought us Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a 1930s French musical in vibrant colour. The opening voice-over with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the camera aperture opens (like the old hand crankers) on a black & white placard. The camera backs off (or rather, up), suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party. This is all in the first 60 seconds.<br /><br />Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of 3 girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film (and yes, I speak French, so I can't blame it on the subtitles). Those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song. Then they leave, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue 15 minutes into the film.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time & musical cacophony. But the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out. I endured.<br /><br />It didn't get much better. I'll tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters. We don't even see their faces half the time (as Resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera). People flit on & off stage like moths around a lamp, and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot. It's as if you were to take every episode of the Brady Bunch and cram it into a 2 hour movie. With bad songs.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me watching as long as I did (1 hour) was that I was looking at the camera techniques, lighting and scenery which were all, I admit, excellent. But is that enough to hold your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I'll try watching the end. Aw, who am I kidding. I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do, too. Skip this.",9.1,2003
109,Stranded in Space,"Sci-Fi, Drama","This movie takes the plot behind the sci-fi flick ""Doppelganger"" (an astronaut from our Earth crashing on a 'counter-Earth' on the opposite side of the Sun, and the Cold War totalitarian vibes on that world) and tries to turn it into a pilot for a TV series. However, the whole thing sank without a trace, and TV is probably better off for it.<br /><br />Everyone here is perfectly adequate in a 'made for TV' way. Cameron Mitchell turns in his usual solid performance. So does Glenn Corbett (who seems to be a kind of poor man's John Saxon) who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the 'World Order' on counter Earth.<br /><br />But the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this Sci-Fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad.<br /><br />I'll give one example: in the original template for this pilot, (""Doppleganger""), the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm, and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence (it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again). Then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds, only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers.<br /><br />In ""Stranded in Space"", the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound, things start shaking, and the camera blurs into a blackout (and as a friend pointed out, it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats, the director wasn't even shaking the camera or the set). I've seen episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"" that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made-for-TV mediocrity.<br /><br />And that, in essence, is what's wrong with ""Stranded In Space"". No budget, no time, no imagination...just making the token gestures and hoping the sci-fi Fan Boys' imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest. Sorry, guys, it didn't work. <br /><br />I'm sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away, and never thought of it again, except as a listing on their C.V. And that's what you, the viewer will do. You'll remember, if pressed, that you once watched a TV movie called ""Stranded In Space"", but it made no lasting impression on you, and you can't recall too much about it.",7,1973
110,Throw Momma From the Train,Black Comedy,"Black comedy isn't always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don't often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, or for serious mayhem. There doesn't seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987.<br /><br />DeVito plays an odd mamma's boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself, he wants desperately to have his mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but he clearly doesn't have the guts to actually do it himself. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. ""The night was...."" Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and murder Larry's ex-wife. Once it appears he has done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. It's certainly never dull and often full of surprises.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film isn't too long, and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.",9.4,1987
113,The Fourth Man,Thriller,"Paul Verhoeven's predecessor to his breakout hit 'Basic Instinct' is a stylish and shocking neo-noir thriller. Verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films, both in his native Holland and in America and this film is one of the reasons why. The Fourth Man follows the strange story of Gerard Reve (played by Jeroen Krabb√©); a gay, alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to Vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes. While there, he meets the seductive Christine Halsslag (Ren√©e Soutendijk) who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him, even if it kills him.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film, and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it. Many of the occurrences in The Fourth Man could be what they appear to be, but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration, and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on. Paul Verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself, and that is one of things I like best about him. This film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards (and that doesn't happen very often!). I wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work...but you'll see what I mean when you see the film (make sure you get the uncut version!). There is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one I've mentioned, but are lovely nonetheless; a man gets eaten by lions, another one has a pipe sent through his skull, a boat is smashed in half...lovely.<br /><br />The acting in The Fourth Man isn't anything to write home about, but it's solid throughout. Jeroen Krabb√© holds the audience's attention and looks the part as the drunken writer. It is Ren√©e Soutendijk that impresses the most, though, as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale. Her performance is what Sharon Stone would imitate nine years later with Basic Instinct, but the original fatale did it best. Paul Verhoeven's direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view, all of which help to create the mystery of the story. Verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish, but he obviously has talent and it's a shame that he doesn't put it to better use. Of all the Verhoeven films I've seen, this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across; trust me, it's worth the effort.",9.4,1983
115,Demon Wind,Horror,"Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs. It is definitely an awful example of a film. So awful in fact that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it more as a thing ... a monstrous thing. A thing that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend's house. It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies (we unfortunately picked this one.) Well, during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up. The thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word. It's just a cheap, poorly done rip-off of Evil Dead. The whole ""story"" seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces. I have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS!!!) (shudder) I would have to say that Demon Wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity. Watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films.<br /><br />Fun fact: This film is like a cockroach on steroids!

117,Winchester '73,Drama/Western,"Winchester 73 gets credit from many critics for bringing back the western after WWII. Director Anthony Mann must get a lot of credit for his excellent direction. Jimmy Stewart does an excellent job, but I think Stephen McNalley and John McIntire steal the movie with their portrayal of two bad guys involved in a high stakes poker game with the treasured Winchester 73 going to the winner. This is a good script with several stories going on at the same time. Look for the first appearance of Rock Hudson as Young Bull. Thank God, with in a few years, we would begin to let Indians play themselves in western films. The film is in black and white and was shot in Tucson Arizona. I would not put Winchester 73 in the category of Stagecoach, High Noon or Shane, but it gets an above average recommendation from me.<br /><br />.",9,1950
118,Satan's Whip,horror,"Sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror. If you can just toe-tap your way through the slow-paced early scenes, sometimes a real gem will present itself... This (unfortunately) was not the case with ""Satan's Whip"".<br /><br />Written and directed by Jason Maran, ""Satan's Whip"" attempts to drag us along on a boring snore-fest of a film, with no real pay off at the end. I'm guessing that the black & white (and blue) cinematography must have been for a reason, however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue, and I found this increasingly annoying as the film went on. The story in itself is not that bad, and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic. This, combined with the slow-pacing and lack of any real (red) gore made ""Satan's Whip"" one to forget quite quickly. I will give it a ""4"" rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle, but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time.",2.3,2006

Incredible layers of personal, and psychologically viable, stories, underscored by sublime cinematography (incredible to use this word, when describing a TV-show), a killer score, great performances and editing. Anyone who isn't hooked on this, are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever.

122,Things to Come,Science Fiction,"The message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of Everytown in 1940 represents England in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. When war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time Everytown is completely destroyed. Adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the ""wandering sickness"", a pestilence that continues for another four years.<br /><br />""Things to Come"" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. The ""Wings Over the World"" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman Cabal (Raymond Massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. If he fails, others will follow. This message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in Massey's end of movie speech. Man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an ""all the universe or nothing"" mindset.<br /><br />The film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film ""Metropolis"". As Everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. Where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.<br /><br />""Things to Come"" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. Which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? It's not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. Those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.",2.3,1936
123,Cat in the Brain,Horror,"Fulci... Does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made? Answer: yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci's movies.<br /><br />Fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one. Lead roll in this movie is no other then Fulci himself, who plays... well horror-splatter-gore director, who thinks he is slowly going insane. It's filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here. Being Fulci flick, you need to know it's gory. How much? Well pretty much. I always loved gore in the movies and I never get enough of it, but Cat in the Brain actually stopped my thirst for gore, and believe me, it's a hard to archive. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves about Fulci, who after being hypnotized by *khmmm* evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey, and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor, which starts to spit some ooze from it's wounds. Forget the Beyond or Zombie 2, this IS the goriest Fulci movie! Now I like how Fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie. He is such a brilliant director. Some funny moments and lines happens from time to time, like one where Fulci says ""making gore movies is kind of a sickness"" Ending is very good considering that Fulci (and most of the Italian horror masters) is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes. If you are fun of the Fulci, make sure you check it out. If you have a weak stomach, avoid this and repeat ""Its only a movie"" ps. some of the gore scenes within this movie: Chainsaw dismemberment (full), tongue torn out, eyeballs torn out, maggot infested corpses, zombies, decapitations, face being putted in boiling water, stabs in the shower (to head), throat slit, many parts of the body and organs being toast aside, hammer smashed face...",2.3,1990
124,Jurassic Park,"Science Fiction, Adventure, Thriller",I love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors. I like raptors because they are scary. My favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the Friday the 13th movie with the girl who eats the banana.<br /><br />I really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it's okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and I think it's got a good ending even though I didn't really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings I figured it out over time and that's the important part. The other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you're watching it the first time.<br /><br />THIS IS BEST MOVIE.,9,1993
125,Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,horror,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS<br /><br />A couple of years back I managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole Elm St. series. However, just two years on and I find I can't remember enough about them in order to do it ¬ñ I guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. From what I do recall, some of the sequels ¬ñ Dream Warriors in particular ¬ñ weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. Generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. But while I cannot recall much of the first five films, I do know they never plumbed the depths of Freddy's Dead.<br /><br />An indication of how sick of Freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. The fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.<br /><br />Taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, Robert Englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. I always thought Freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. It's like Englund's crying out ""we know this is garbage ¬ñ but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?"" And I'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. Was Freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? All he gets to do here is a few ""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr ¬ñ har ¬ñ har ¬ñ hars"" and that's it. If this was the only Elm St. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. Even as the character pre-death in a flashback Englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of Transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.<br /><br />Acting is almost universally poor. Just look at how many times Breckin Meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. Only Kananga himself, Yaphet Kotto, keeps his dignity. And when Roseanne, Tom Arnold and Alice Cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. The script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. Carlos (Ricky Dean Logan) opens a road map, upon which the Noel Coward-like Freddy has wittily written ""you're f**ked"". When prompted for the map, Carlos responds ""well the map says we're f**ked"". Who wrote the screenplay, Oscar Wilde?<br /><br />Or how about the scene where Carlos is tortured by Freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? So Freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin ¬ñ a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. Oddly, the fact that Carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. ""Nice hearing from you, Carlos"", quips Freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. It's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into Freddy's world. Though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-D finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.<br /><br />The teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. Tracy (Lezlie Deane) is the only one who gets to greet Freddy with ""shut the f**k up, man"" and a kick in the scallops. And was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? Freddy's Dead. No laughs. No scares. No interest. No fun.<br /><br />",2.2,1991
126,dog bite dog,"Action, Crime, Thriller","Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s, but although it is undoubtedly brutal, violent and very downbeat, this film from Pou-Soi Cheang isn't really sleazy, lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison. However, it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch, particularly if gritty, hard-edged action is your thing.<br /><br />Edison Chen plays Pang, a Cambodian hit-man who travels to Hong Kong to assassinate the wife of a judge; Sam Lee is Wai, the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down, whatever the cost. With Wai closing in on his target, Pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape¬óuntil he meets Yue, a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse.<br /><br />A relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography, amazing sound design, a haunting score, and solid performances from Chen and Lee (as well as newcomer Pei Pei as Pang's love interest), Dog Bite Dog is one for fans of hard-hitting Asian hyper-violence (think along the lines of Chan-wook Park's Vengeance trilogy). Stabbings, shootings, merciless beatings: all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director Cheang.<br /><br />Of course, this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved, and sure enough, pretty much everyone in this film dies (rather nasty deaths). Unfortunately, there is a fine line between tragedy and (unintentional) comedy, and in its final moments, Dog Bite Dog crosses it: in a laughably over-dramatic final scene, Pang and Wai are locked in battle as a pregnant Yue looks on. Eventually, after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas, a wounded Pang performs a DIY Ceasarean on (a now dead) Yue, delivering their baby moments before he himself dies.<br /><br />Whilst this film might not be a 'classic' slice of Hong Kong excess, with its deliriously OTT action and stylish visuals, it's still worth seeking out.",2.5,2006
128,Panic in the Streets,"Crime, Drama","In New Orleans, an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal Blackie (Walter Jack Palance). He is chased by Blackie and his men Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Poldi (Guy Thomajan), killed by Blackie and his body is dumped in the sea. During the autopsy, the family man Lieutenant Commander Dr. Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) of the U.S. Public Health Service finds that the dead man had pneumonic plague caused by rats and he needs to find who had any type of contact with the man within forty-eight hours to avoid an epidemic. The City Mayor assigns the skeptical Captain Tom Warren (Paul Douglas) to help Dr. Clint to find the killers that are infected with the plague and inoculate them.<br /><br />""Panic in the Streets"" discloses a simple story, but it is still effective and with a great villain. The engaging plot has not become dated after fifty-seven years. Jack Palance performs a despicable scum in his debut, and the camera work while he tries to escape with Zero Mostel is still very impressive. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): ""P√¢nico nas Ruas"" (""Panic in the Streets"")",2.8,1950
129,Waco: The Rules of Engagement,Documentary,"There have been many documentaries that I have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence - The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost come to mind first and foremost. But this is the first film that had me seething with anger after I saw it. It seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the FBI and AFI, and at the very worst an act of murder. Like most people, when the siege at Waco was occurring I assumed that David Koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult. After seeing this, I think that Koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the U.S. government through his eccentric actions. Sure, there were lots of weapons at the Branch Davidian compound. But none of it was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound, all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless. And it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the Waco site, the clueless testimony of Janet Reno, and the partisan defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by a few of the committee Democrats. Standing out most in my mind was NY representative and current U.S. senator from NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in NY state - I'm a Democrat, pretty left-leaning too. After seeing his actions on this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For anyone remotely interested in the government, this is a very crucial film, a must see. I even think this should be shown in classes - it's that important.",2.2,1997
130,Stella Dallas,"Drama, Romance","Yes, I call this a perfect movie. Not one boring second, a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors, a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives I could sympathize with, perfect lighting, crisp black and white photography, a fitting soundtrack, an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works. It's one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of Hollywood should rest, the mark everyone should endeavor to reach.<br /><br />Barbara Stanwyck is simply stunning. There was nothing this actress couldn't do, and she always went easy on the melodramatic side. No hysterical outbursts with this lady - I always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like Bette Davis or Joan Crawford, and this movie confirmed my opinion. Always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments. It is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career, and this one is by far the least interesting.<br /><br />The title fits this movie very well. It is about desires, human desires I think everyone can understand. Actually, no one seems to be scheming in this movie, all characters act on impulse, everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else. The sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which I will not go here.<br /><br />I liked what this movie has to say about youth, about maturing and about the necessity to compromise. The movie I associate most with this one is Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of a Doubt, it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured Small Town America. The story has a certain similarity with Fritz Lang's considerably harsher movie Clash by Night, made one year earlier, where Stanywck stars in a similar part. I can also recommend it.",9.4,1937
131,Hoot,"Family, Adventure, Comedy","I saw the movie ""Hoot"" and then I immediately decided to comment it. The truth is that NATURE needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet. Some people think that if they have money, they can do whatever they want to, which probably is like, but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful! This movie is not just about kids, this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do. When I was twelve, I saw some waterlilies and I knew they are protected by law and didn't even dare to touch them not fearing of the law, but fearing that I might harm them actually. (I am currently 15) What so ever, the acting was great, the 3 main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them. I hope you all think about what you saw in that movie!!! and Enjoy!",9.2,2006
132,Surviving Christmas,"Comedy, Romance","I had some reservations about this movie, I figured it would be the usual bill of fare --- a formula movie about Christmas. Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June, we decided to give it a shot anyway, maybe we would see some snow.<br /><br />This movie turned out to be one laugh after another. Ben Affleck was believable in his character, but the real star of this one is James Gandofini. He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great ""dad"".<br /><br />If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours, definitely check this one out.",9,2004
135,Alexander Nevsky,"War,Drama","In ""Brave New Girl,"" Holly comes from a small town in Texas, sings ""The Yellow Rose of Texas"" at a local competition, and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in Philadelphia. From there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty. I loved this movie. It was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace. The acting was, of course, wonderful. Virginia Madsen and Lindsey Haun were outstanding, as well as Nick Roth The camera work was really done well and I was very pleased with the end (It seems a sequel could be in the making). Kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.",9.4,1938
136,The Messengers,"Horror,Thriller","Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clich√©d, sub-par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending. Clue #1 for all considering seeing this turkey: Sam Raimi didn't direct it. Although commercials for the movie play up his involvement, in truth he is one of four producers. It's too bad that someone as talented as Raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie. I don't think he would ever have directed something like this; that task was left to the Pang Brothers.<br /><br />The screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other ""horror"" films, so you'll find absolutely zero original content in ""The Messengers."" What we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of ""Pulse,"" a couple that could have come from ""The Birds,"" one or two from ""The Others,"" etc. Nearly every scene, almost every line of dialogue, is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies. The whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the ""surprise ending"" long before it comes.<br /><br />Right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign, centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts, has nothing to do with this movie. In fact, everyone can see the ghosts. The teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them, even quite early in the movie. I'm sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal, which otherwise is entirely absent. Now you know, so don't be fooled! Perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors. It simply isn't there. All of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted. Coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes (just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened, anyhow? Didn't anyone think to maybe arrest him?), it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes, and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling ""Boo!"" All we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly-made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house. If there's any message that ""The Messengers"" delivers, it's ""Don't waste your time on this movie.""",2.6,2007
137,The Guardian,"Action,Drama","I was looking forward to The Guardian, but when I walked into the theater I wasn't really in the mood for it at that particular time. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit. The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Kevin Costner movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise Ashton Kutcher showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him. Something about the guy just annoys me. Probably has to do with his simian features.<br /><br />It took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away. The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than Kenny Rogers' orange face lift. My concerns briefly bristled at Kutcher's initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make George Clooney proud? Yeah, we get it. I was totally ready to hate him.<br /><br />But then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /><br />Darn you, ape man! Efficiently mixing tense, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor, and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a film that I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can quibble about its clich√©s, predictability, and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of that takes away from the entertainment value.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen, so I feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under-appreciated group.<br /><br />Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it -you get to go on dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then you must fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia, and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded, panicked people who are depending on you for their survival. And if all that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies.<br /><br />Man, who wants all that responsibility? Not me! I had no idea what it was really like for these guys, and who would have thought I'd have an Ashton Kutcher/Kevin Costner movie to thank for the education? <br /><br />Not only does The Guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero, but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers.<br /><br />THE GIST <br /><br />Moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it's like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give The Guardian a chance. I saw it for free, but had I paid I would've felt I had gotten my money's worth.",9.4,2006
138,Seven Pounds,"Drama, Romance","Going into see Seven Pounds i wasn't clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about. So within the first 20 min or so you are completely lost in the plot, have no idea what is going on and you think Tim, who claims to be Ben, is just a big asshole. All of this comes to an end when the ""twist"",so to speak, is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie. Basically Tim (will smith) was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives. By this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to.<br /><br />The acting of this film is great, as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress. Rosario Dawson, to me, this is one of her better movies, aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to. She has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film. Other actors, such as woody Harrelson, have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character. Although the casting of the film was still good.<br /><br />This movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped. The movie, however, was still pretty good. Nothing is revealed until the last 5 min of the movie and everything falls into place. Up until then it just seems like a pointless love story. Final thought seven pounds=seven Stars.",9.1,2008
139,Brothers Shadow Drama 2006,Drama 2006,"I saw Brother's Shadow at the Tribeca Film Festival and loved it! Judd Hirsch and Scott Cohen are great as father and son.

He shows up there because his brother has died, and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother's wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family. The story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives.

Instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains. The mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems. There is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters. The mad doctor's nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy. The results are not good. This is a class C film with OK acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors. There isn't much zombie action in this one and the effects, while adequate, are nothing special. You can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes. Watch out for some nudity and bad language.",2.5,2006
141,The Scoundrel,Drama,"It's a unique film, as it gives us our only chance to see the young Noel Coward in all his ironic glory. Because he seems so reserved & detached he's perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter-of-factly uses all those around him. However in the deadly serious (no pun intended) last act, when Coward must make like the Flying Dutchman, he's much less comfortable.<br /><br />But his way with an epigram is peerless, and Hecht & Macarthur have given him some gems (Macarthur, really -- he was the wit of the pair).<br /><br />The film is superbly lighted by the great Lee Garmes, but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence. Hecht and Macarthutr cared about one thing -- getting their dialogue on screen. (NOTE: H&M themselves have blink-and-you'll-miss-'em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene).<br /><br />The most notable supporting player is the one and only Alexander Woolcott, notorious Broadway columnist and close friend of both Macarthur and Coward, who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher Coward.<br /><br />Curious that Woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary Algonquin Round Table, of which he was a founder, and Macarthur something of an auxiliary member.<br /><br />The Scoundrel actually won an Oscar for best story, though that victory is probably due more to Coward's imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot. It's Coward, Woolcott, and the dialogue you remember...",9.2,1935
142,Asterix & Obelix: Mission Cleopatra,comedy,"This is definitely a ""must see"" film. The excellent Director Alain Chabat (also acting as Ceasar) has managed to capture the very essence of the ""Adventures of Ast√©rix"" (the French comic books it's based upon) and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy, which is also an homage to the world of animated films. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all, between your bursts of laughter. The only drawback is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French speaking audience) might not get all the ""private jokes"". There are so many dialogues impossible to translate, so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the French way of life, that the fun might be lessened. However, it's still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture, the amazing stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All actors are great, but the film would not be the same without Jamel Debouze, G√©rard Darmon and Edouard Baer.

143,Artemisia,drama,"I thought this movie was stunning, with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi (Artemisia Gentileschi).<br /><br />Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully, with tentative yet confidant mannerisms, her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place. The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch.<br /><br />Although not each character was overtly beautiful, this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time.<br /><br />Overall i thought this film was fantastic.",9.1,1997
144,Gentleman Jim,"Drama, Biography","I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the best boxing movie ever made. That is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie might be number 1, but ""Gentleman Jim"" is a close number 2.<br /><br />The movie doesn't just chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />""Gentleman Jim"" is not a realistic look at those days. It is romanticized and, yes, even a bit hokey at times. But always delightfully so. Errol Flynn is perfect as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the great John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But wonderful. Hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. That is a much more realistic boxing movie. But ""Gentleman Jim"" is a lot more fun.",9.4,1942

147,Committed,"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Some people drift through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye; others latch on to a cause, another person or a principle and remain adamant, committed to whatever it is-- and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. But we're all different, `Made of different clay,' as one of the characters in this film puts it, which is what makes life so interesting. Some people are just plain crazy, though-- and maybe that's the way you have to be to live among the masses. Who knows? Who knows what it takes to make things-- life-- work? Writer/director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it, using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed-- and how one `gets' committed-- and obsession, in `Committed,' starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is adamant, committed, obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy, too. Her name is Joline, and this is her story.<br /><br /> Admittedly, Joline has always been a committed person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She's a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what. And when she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it's forever. The only problem is, someone forgot to tell Carl-- and 597 days into the marriage, he's gone; off to `find' himself and figure it all out. When Joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up on him, or their marriage. Maybe it's because of that `clay' she's made of. Regardless, she leaves their home in New York City and sets off to find him, which she does-- in El Paso, Texas, of all places. But once she knows where he is, she keeps her distance, giving him his `space' and not even letting him know she's there. She considers Carl as being in a `spiritual coma,' and it's her job to keep a `spiritual vigil' over him until he comes to his senses. And while she watches and waits, her life is anything but dull, as she encounters a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen's `Grampy,' (Alfonso Arau), who is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has issues concerning Carl; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her. For Joline, it's a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot about Carl, but even more about herself.<br /><br /> There's a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot. And Krueger presents it all extremely well, delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining. Her characters are very real people, with all the wants, needs and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. We see it from Joline's point-of-view, as Krueger makes us privy to Joline's thoughts and therefore her motivations, which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold. That, along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates, makes for a very effective piece of storytelling. There's an underlying seriousness to this subject matter, but Krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy-handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that Joline encounters. And the result is a well textured, affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life.<br /><br /> Heather Graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make Joline a character totally of her own creation. She immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable, adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person, and one that is real. And for this film to work, it was imperative that Joline be viable and believable-- and Graham succeeds on all fronts. Her screen presence has never been more alluring, and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes, is enough to draw you in entirely. it's all a part of the character she creates; there's an appeal to Joline that exudes from her entire countenance, who she is inside and out. She's a likable, agreeable person, and because you've shared her innermost thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all the way around, beginning with the way the character was written, to the way Graham brings her so vibrantly to life.<br /><br /> As Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is totally engaging, as well. Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character. She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down-to-earth. She is refreshingly open and up-front; you get the impression that Carmen is not one to hold anything back, but is totally honest on all fronts, and that, too, is part of her appeal. And, as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez brings her convincingly to life.<br /><br /> Overall, there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who, with very little actual screen time, manages to create a memorable character.<br /><br /> The supporting cast includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor), and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist). A film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider The Big Picture-- reflecting upon who we are, where we're going and what we really need-- `Committed' is an enjoyable experience; a ride definitely worth taking. 8/10.",9.4,2000

149,Tail Sting,Comedy,"This movie is stupid. There's no getting around it. But so is Dumb and Dumber. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber is significantly more funny than this. However, I for one love seeing stupid movies (Tail Sting) and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is. Call me callous, but see this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it.",7.5,2001
150,A Little Princess,Family,"I was looking forward to this so much, being a big fan of the book. However, when it came out I remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time I've ever spent at the cinema.<br /><br />In principle, the acting, the sets and the music were excellent, and are the main reason why I'm rating this a 4.<br /><br />In this version, Sara is a little too self-sacrificing for my taste. There is no way she would have deliberately lied to Miss Minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls; in the book she makes a point of describing lies as ""not just wicked, but vulgar."" <br /><br />There's also far too much of a Disneyfied ending for me; Sara's father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the Indian sunset. While the book does have a happy (and critics might say equally improbable) ending, it doesn't leave you thinking, ""Oh puh-leeze.""<br /><br />About the only things true to the book were:<br /><br />1. Sara's father being a soldier 2. The lines between Sara and her father (""Are you learning me by heart?""/""No. I know you by heart. You are inside my heart."") 3. Sara's friendship with Becky, and her 'adopting' Lottie (although this last one wasn't developed as much as it could have been) 4. The changing of her room by adding various luxury items. That part was brilliantly done. 5. The basic core - a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly - is there, but that's about all that is.<br /><br />People might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience. Possibly. All I can say to that is I have two cousins - aged 7 and 12 respectively - who were big fans of this film until they read the book.<br /><br />If all you want is a 'feel-good' family film, then this delivers. If you're looking for a film that actually tells the story of A Little Princess (in fact, if you've read the book) don't waste time with this one. It's such a shame; with a cast like this, if they'd stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic.<br /><br />Am I harping on about 'read the book' this and 'read the book' that a little too much? Very probably. But if someone attempts to adapt a book - especially such a classic - into a movie, then they should at least have done the same thing. Preferably more than once.",9.1,1995
151,Clara's Heart,drama,"i really in enjoyed watching this movie. like most of the people that watched it. i wasn't sure that i was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act.<br /><br />however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with comedic moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking.<br /><br />this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie. this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks, but also about relations with in the black community. i do think that it is worth a chance. if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn't for you",8,1988
153,Baseball,documentry,"Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" is a decent documentary... it presents a clear origin of the game, a great depiction of baseball's early years and heroes. There's plenty in this movie for any baseball fan... that said, the film has several glaring flaws.<br /><br />18 hours is simply too long for the human attention span. It's clear that Burns stretched his film out to fit his ""nine inning"" concept. It's not even a tight 18 hours... the pace on every segment is slow, almost morose... the music always nostalgic and wistful. Isn't baseball ever exciting and fun? Why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy? Talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak, yakking about baseball as a metaphor, baseball as Americana, the psychology and theology of baseball... enough! This is syrupy, mawkish drivel. Billy Crystal is here to sell us all the Yankee hokum he's sold us before. Ken Burns uses the National Anthem as the series' theme song, and manages to play ""Take Me Out To The Ballgame"" so many times you might vomit. We get it, dude.<br /><br />Clearly Burns is a neo-Hollywood faux-liberal, so he spends probably a third of the film on the Negro leagues... these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open-minded as Kenny is today. For shame! He chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that America was segregated in those times! Burns falls head over heels in love with Buck O'Neil, a former negro-league player, and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly O'Neil waxes poetic about his playing days. Nonsense...<br /><br />Burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down. ""Baseball"" winds up as mushy, gushy, civil-rights propaganda disguised as Americana. Its clear that Burns is not a baseball fan... otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering, not weeping and reciting soliloquies... are you listening, Mr. Burns? There's no crying in baseball.",9.2,1994
154,Quitting,drama,"""Quitting"" may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. As a rural guy coming to Beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents' acting success. Troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. The ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. Hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.<br /><br />But what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director Zhang Yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. No clich√©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. <br /><br />Hongshen Jia is in his mid-twenties. He's a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. The perfect recipe for his enablers. Soon he's the ""cool"" actor, idolized by youth. ""He was hot in the early nineties."" ""He always had to be the most fashionable."" He needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. His acting means the arts, friends--and roles, But not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. And his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- ""I didn't know how to act"" ""I felt like a phony""--and to readily available drugs to counter them. He says ""I had to get high to do what director wanted."" So, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. <br /><br />Hongshen's disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. Solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. The abstract is out. And a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of Beijing. The physicality is almost romantic, but is not. The bike rides to Ritan Park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. He drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. ""I started to open up"" he says of this period in retrospect. And the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer's positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. If mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. <br /><br />Central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. To punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and TV, and bangs his head till bloody against his ""John Lennon Forever"" poster. He has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but he's the only viable guide he knows. He even imagines himself as John's son (Yoko Ono), and adopts his ""Mother Mary"" as an intercessor in his ""hour of darkness"" and ""time of trouble."" (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) ""Music is so much more real than acting"" he says. And speaks of Lennon's influence as ""showing me a new way."" In the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect Lennon's presence, as does Hongshen's need to re-hang his hero's poster in his redecorated room.<br /><br />If Lennon's influence is spiriting, Hongshen's father's influence is grounding. Although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is Fegsen's differences from his son that underwrites his change. For the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that he's Chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. And he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. It's this recognizable identity that drives Hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, Beatles) and passivity. In his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: ""all the acts I acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit."" And to Hongshen's emphatic ""you are NOT my father,"" he softly replies, ""why can't a peasant be your father?"" <br /><br />Under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. As the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. Indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. Integrity banishes his black cloud. All his edges soften. ""You are just a human being"" he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. Back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. And his once ""rare and true friendships"" begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. Hongshen says of this movie: ""it's a good chance to think about my life."" And I might add, become a New Actor, one bound to art and life. Like Lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.",9.2,2001
155,Alien vs. Predator,"Science Fiction,Horror","If only I had read the review by Alex Sander (sic) on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public I would not have seen this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well made horror/sci-fi. Predator was a great sci-fi/action mess-about. I do really have only myself to blame though as I saw 'Alien versus Predator'. It too has an average grading of over 6 stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site.<br /><br />STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FEAR OF THIS EVER SO SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT BEING RUINED FOR YOU.<br /><br />Right from the beginning this film was ridiculous. No explanation was offered for the Predator ship overrun/not overrun by Aliens. OK so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to Earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an Alien/Predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology? The start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why. From then on it gets really ridiculous. I always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out. I couldn't here.<br /><br />A father and son are hunting in the woods. The damaged ship crash lands to (from the view given) I would calculate at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick woodland. The man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged. Even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible, dumb redneck muppet.<br /><br />An edgy, thriller-type scenario is introduced with an ex-con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless, dull now cop friend from the bus. When I say introduced I mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out. A slasher/horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective, crazy, nasty Jock type (American sportsman not a Scottish man). Oh the cute/not cute boy is the ex-con's brother by the way. Yes they're clever these director brothers whose name I will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again. Then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at PC, Ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child.<br /><br />Guess what happens next? I won't tell you much more about the actual (smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films) plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the Alien-ridden universe.<br /><br />The Predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post I read too late. The Aliens are boring. The Predator-Alien is ridiculous. The action is at times exploitative, gratuitous, disgusting nonsense. The hospital scene with the pregnant mothers?!?! Oh I was shocked alright. Shocked at how low some people will go to get what? A scare? Some shock? To titillate the perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the Alien/Predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them? The characters have no depth and neither does the plot. It's filmed and paced badly. It's acted by disinterested people not that I can blame them. It further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci-fi characters. This film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it I really have to worry about you. If you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision.<br /><br />PS Did I even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout?",2.2,2004

The temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so-called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that.<br /><br />Of the performances, There is scarcely a poor performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally cast. Also good is Stanley Baker as the Thief-Taker and Alan Badel is good as always.<br /><br />Because the film sticks to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family.",9,1966
157,The Informer,Drama,"Victor McLaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history.<br /><br />I think we can all feel for ""Gypo"" because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong. This was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major American movie studio (RKO Radio Pictures).<br /><br />Joseph H. August's cinematography is at its very best here. However, August's stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn't receive the Oscar nomination he rightly deserved.<br /><br />This is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible.",7,1935
158,Armored,"Action,Crime","How do you take a cast of experienced, well-known actors, and put together such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: Armored. Six co-workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves. But, just as they get to first base with their plans, everything unravels quickly. With a plot like this, you'd think it couldn't be too bad, at least for an action movie. However, in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal, everyday kind of guys. They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then, we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business. The hero Ty, (Columbus Short), is sucked into the scheme because of the cold, cruel world, even though he's a decorated veteran, nice guy, and reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular guys nearly all turn into money-crazed psychos, willing to butcher each other for cash. In the last scenes Mike, (Matt Dillon), goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's utterly unbelievable and ""B movie"" is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot. I would say don't waste your time--too bad no one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before making this picture.",2.7,2009
159,"Sandra, the Making of a Woman",Sexploitation/Drama,"The sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn. It's peak years were between 1968 and 1972. One of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was Monica Gayle, who had a small but fanatic cult of followers. She was actually able to act, unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks, and her subsequent credits proved it. And her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique.<br /><br />Gary Graver, the director, was also a talent; probably too talented for the sexploitation genre, and his skill, combined with Monica Gayle's screen presence, makes Sandra, the Making of a Woman, a pleasantly enjoyable experience. The film never drags and you won't have your finger pressed on the fast-forward button.",9.1,1970
160,Gentleman Jim,"biography,drama","Flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. Playing real-life boxing champ Jim Corbett, Flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled San Francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb Smith. He and best pal Carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. The next day, he gets a chance, via Smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. He uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. His unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion John L. Sullivan (Bond.) Flynn is downright magical here. He is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. He looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) His line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. Smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for Flynn. At this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. She is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. Bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. Amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient Carson. Frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as Flynn's manager. The rest of the cast is excellent as well including Flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy Nob Hill types. The whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. A few of the sets are amazingly presented. Some of Smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. It's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. Some of it (like the character traits shown by Flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) One line is particularly memorable: ""I believe you like me more than I like you, but it's entirely possible that I love you more than you love me."" It's classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.)",9.4,1942
162,Grey Owl,"biography,drama","I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and thought it was wonderful, especially since it was based on a true man. Pierce Brosnan was very good as the loner English man who took on the persona of the half breed Grey Owl. The photography was beautiful.<br /><br />This movie made me do more research into this character Archie Belaney known simple as Grey Owl. I want to read as much as I can about him. At the time I did not know Richard Attenborough had directed it. But I am not surprised. I like all his movies whether he is acting or directing. I gave it the highest rating. However, I would have liked to have seen more in the movie about WHY he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes.",9.1,1999

165,Where the Sidewalk Ends,"Crime, Drama","Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Otto Preminger's 'Where the Sidewalks Ends,' from a really excellent script by Ben Hecht based on the novel 'Night Cry' by Frank Rosenberg...<br /><br />Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks... When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points up the title. 'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?' he asks Andrews. 'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.'<br /><br />Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta...<br /><br />By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect... The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...<br /><br />Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...<br /><br />The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best... <br /><br />Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism...",2.5,1950
168,Johnny Yuma,"Drama,Western","This is a very memorable spaghetti western. It has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from Rosalba Neri. Her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. She steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. Her performance is very believable. She manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). Mark Damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.<br /><br />The music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. There are a couple of parts that are very amusing. I especially like the part where Rosalba Neri undresses in front of the parrot. There's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done.<br /><br />I would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. The first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. This is one of the most ridiculous looking fights I have ever seen in a movie. It is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. One might be able to overlook this if it were a Terence Hill/Bud Spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. The other thing that annoyed me about this movie was Yuma's cowardly Mexican sidekick. I guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. All I can say is where is Tuco when you need him? <br /><br />All that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that Johnny Yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults I have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.",7,1966

After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.<br /><br />Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today.<br /><br />But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch.<br /><br />The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. <br /><br />Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he'd have liked it better in the way I describe.<br /><br />This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br /><br />When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.<br /><br />So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction. Like 21 Baker Street for Sherlock Holmes fans, the ranchhouse and the Cartwrights are real.<br /><br />And if they weren't real, they should have been.",9.4,1959
170,Darling Lili,Musical/War/Romance,"Years ago, when DARLING LILI played on TV, it was always the pan and scan version, which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format. So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie Andrews/Blake Edwards opus, I decided to purchase and watch it once and for all.<br /><br />Boy, what a terrible film. It's so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong. Looking at it now, it's obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE, etc) but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc) because Hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort, to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story/war movie/romance/slapstick comedy/musical. DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities, never knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole, it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing.<br /><br />Mind you, the version on the DVD is the ""director's cut"", or in this case, ""let's salvage whatever we can"" from this notorious box office flop. In releasing the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19!!!!!!!!) from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version. The film moves along with no idea of what it is. We are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going. What kind of spy is Lili? How powerful is she? Was she ever responsible for someone's death? Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews. Things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall for Hudson? Why him and not other men she got involved with? There should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings. There's no catalyst in this story.<br /><br />One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews' (and Edwards') previous successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, that scene might have worked on a certain level but today, that moment reeks of desperation. There are other plot elements directly inspired by Andrews/Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE. The musical moment ""I'll give you three guesses"" was created just to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona, which is turned ""raunchy"" with Julie doing a striptease in the act. The ending, bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plane, is another ""wink"" at SOUND OF MUSIC.<br /><br />The whole thing is confusing. Julie plays a singer, born from a German father and British mother, who lives in England but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are just badly edited. Like when Julie and her ""uncle"" are on horseback. They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in mid-sentence. I'm like ""what happened here?""<br /><br />The comedy bits are unfunny and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police are pathetic. Where's Peter Sellers when you really need him. The action is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her ""uncle"" are on their way to Germany on that train, Hudson's squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train, almost killing Lili in the process. Brilliant. What's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning. That's one slow moving train there. <br /><br />The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the entire film (and the reason I gave this film 3 stars) but it's effect is diminished considerably because it's repeated at the end. Speaking of redundant, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? The ""Girl in no man's land"" is OK even if it's bleeding obvious, but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital, making me wonder: how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying?<br /><br />The whole project is listless and without energy. The romance is 100% unbelievable. Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks dazed, like she's on Valium. But what really kills this ill-conceived project is Julie playing a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she's no Greta Garbo, who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI. Funny enough, even if Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as cloying and cute.<br /><br />How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since its release, Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release.",9.2,1970
171,Ride with the Devil,drama,"One of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers, an observation which mystifies me. Not only directed by the acclaimed Ang Lee,it had many young actors who were to become major stars, e.g., Tobey Maguire (before Spiderman), Skeet Ulrich (before Jericho), Jonathan Rhys Meyers (before Tudors), James Caviezel, Simon Baker, Mark Ruffalo, Jeffrey Wright, Tom Wilkinson, and Jewel. All of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances, especially Meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing.<br /><br />When the biographies and accomplishments of the director ( even when he won an academy award) and the actors are listed, this film is usually omitted from their past performances. I discovered the film on DVD by accident and it became one of my most often watched films. However, it is seldom every seen on cable. I look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known.",3.8,1999
173,Brown at Harvard,"silent,comedy","This is apparently the second remake of this film, having been filmed before in 1911 and 1918. And, in so many ways it reminds me of the later film, A YANK AT OXFORD. Both films concern a conceited blow-hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both, ultimately, show the blow-hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency. In this film, William Haines is ""Tom Brown"" and his main rival, ""Bob"" is played by Frances X. Bushman. And, in a supporting role is Jack Pickford--always remembered as the brother of Mary. Of these three, Pickford comes off the best, as the sympathetic loser who becomes Tom's pal--he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the Big Game! All the standard clich√©s are there and the movie, because it was done so many times before and since, offers few surprises. However, it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing.<br /><br />In my opinion, for a better silent college film, try Harold Lloyd's THE FRESHMAN--it's football scenes are frankly more exciting and Harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying Tom Brown. THE FRESHMAN is probably the best college picture you can find from the era. Another reason why BROWN AT HARVARD is a lesser picture is that William Haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again (such as in WESTPOINT and THE SMART SET, among others)--and if you've seen one of these films, you've seen them all. Well made, but certainly NOT original! And, because it is just a rehash of his other films, anyone giving the film a score of 10 is STRONGLY advised to see these other films.<br /><br />4/25/08==I just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on IMDb from the 1920!! Talk about over-rated! There are dozens and dozens of better films--how this film got to be #1 is anyone's guess.",9.2,1926
174,macbeth,drama,"This movie illustrates like no other the state of the Australian film industry and everything that's holding it back.<br /><br />Awesome talent, outstanding performances (particularly by Victoria Hill), but a let down in practically every other way.<br /><br />An ""adaptation"" of sorts, it brought nothing new to Macbeth (no, setting it in present-day Australia is not enough), and essentially, completely failed to justify its existence, apart from (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) paying homage to the original work. If there's one body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's Shakespeare's. So any adaptation, if it's not to be a self-indulgent and pointless exercise, needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work.<br /><br />And that's what this Macbeth fails to do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever. It's the same piece that we have seen countless (too many!) times before. Except with guns and in different outfits.<br /><br />Apart from the fundamental blunder (no other way to put it) of keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end, during which I completely tuned out, even though I was looking at the screen. I never thought I had a short attention span, but there you go.<br /><br />I suppose the movie succeeds on its own, very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class acting talent, its movie-makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms, and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with.<br /><br />A shame. An absolute shame.",6.5,2006
175,Throw Momma From The Train,comedy,"Owen loves his Mamma...only he'd love her better six feet under in this dark, laugh-out-loud comedy that both stars and is directed by Danny DeVito, with admirable assists from Billy Crystal and Anne Ramsey in the title role.<br /><br />""Throw Momma From The Train"" is a terrific comedy, even if it isn't a great film. It's too shallow in parts, and the ending feels less organic than tacked on. But it's a gut-splitting ride most of the way, with Crystal and DeVito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer (DeVito is avid but untalented; Crystal is blocked and bitter).<br /><br />Crystal's Professor Donner believes his ex-wife stole his book (the unfortunately titled ""Hot Fire"") and can't write more than the opening line of his next book, which doesn't come easy. He teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities, including a middle-aged woman who writes Tom Clancy-type fiction but doesn't know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through; and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life. Mr. Pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs-per-minutes-on-screen, an ascot-wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus: ""100 Girls I'd Like To Pork.""<br /><br />Then there's DeVito's Owen Lift, who calls himself Professor Donner's ""star pupil"" even though the teacher won't read his work in class. Owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie, a man-child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother, Anne Ramsey, who calls him ""lardass"" and other endearing sentiments. In any other movie, we'd be asked to feel sorry for Owen, but ""Throw Momma From The Train"" piles life's cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along. That's one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people.<br /><br />For those of us who enjoy the humor of this character, even identifying with him, and take the rest of what we see here as a lark, it's not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes, asking us to watch in amusement while Owen enlists Professor Donner's help in a plan to kill his mother. Actually, he first goes to Hawaii to kill Donner's hated ex, then tells the professor it's his turn to kill Mrs. Lift, ""swapping murders"" as seen in Hitchcock's ""Strangers On A Train.""<br /><br />As a director, DeVito not only complements his actors' performances with scene-setting that places the accent on dialogue, he makes some bold visual statements, throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes (and away from taking things too seriously.)<br /><br />Also helping matters is writer Stu Silver, who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter. ""You got rats the size of Oldsmobiles here."" ""She's not a woman...She's the Terminator."" ""One little murder and I'm Jack the Ripper."" Those are all Crystal's words, but some of the funniest lines, which work only in context but absolutely kill, are DeVito's and Ramsey's. Apparently Silver never wrote another screenplay after this, according to the IMDb, and that's a shame, because he had real talent for it.<br /><br />The best scene in this movie, when Crystal meets Ramsey, was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical 'coming attraction' presentation, the only time I've seen a movie promoted that way. Owen introduces the professor to his mother as 'Cousin Patty,' and when Momma says he doesn't have a Cousin Patty, panicky Owen loses it. 'You lied to me,' he yells out, slamming the professor's forehead with a pan.<br /><br />Of course, in reality the professor wouldn't groan out something witty from the floor, but 'Throw Momma From The Train' works effectively at such moments, when playing its Looney Tunes vibe for all its worth. DeVito hasn't disappeared from films, of course, but it's a mystery why he hasn't really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie. Maybe it's because, as 'Throw Momma From The Train's lack of mainstream success shows, his kind of vision isn't to everyone's tastes. That's too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over, and like it.",6.6,1987

A good thriller that works.Delivers both mystery and subterfuge.How reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen.Sentenced to unfair penalties.Even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent, friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie.

178,Charlie Wilson's War,"Comedy, Drama, Biography","It doesn't happen very often, but occasionally one man can make a difference -- a big difference.<br /><br />George Crile's 2003 best seller, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR, is a fascinating and eye-opening account of the most unlikely ""difference maker"" imaginable. A relatively obscure Congressman from the Second District of Texas, ""Good Time Charlie"" was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation. Likable and licentious (even for a politician), Charlie Wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of Lufkin only really wanted two things, their guns and to be left alone. It's Easy Street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known, appropriately enough, as Charlie's Angels.<br /><br />When asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive, young aides his response is a classic, ""You can teach 'em to type, but you can't teach 'em to grow tits."" No argument there.<br /><br />But even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath, and for Charlie Wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in Afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter, humiliating defeat of the Russian military and, possibly, to even help hasten the end of the Cold War as a result. Fat chance, huh?<br /><br />Under the skillful direction of Mike Nichols and a smart, snappy screenplay by Adam Sorkin, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a sparkling, sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind-the- scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising ""Charlie's Team.""<br /><br />The on-screen ""Team,"" is composed of three marvelous actors with four (4) Academy Awards and nine (9) nominations between them. Charlie is beautifully portrayed by Tom Hanks in a solid, slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years. He's aided, abetted and abedded by Joanne Herring, a wealthy Houston socialite played by the still-slinky Julia Roberts. Hey, why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this? By all accounts Ms. Roberts looks good and holds her own, but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why Kabul and country is so important to her character. Maybe the two Afghan hounds usually by her side know -- but we as an audience never do. As for the third member of the ""Team,"" Philip Seymour Hoffman steals every scene he appears in as Gust Aurakotos, a smart, street- wise (i.e. non Ivy League graduate) CIA malcontent who knows the score -- both in the Agency's boardroom and in Wilson's bedroom.<br /><br />For the Mujahideen to succeed, the most important assistance the U.S. can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded MI-21 helicopter gunships which rule the skies. This takes money, lots of money, and eventually ""Charlie's Team"" covertly coerces those in Congress to fund the effort to the tune of $1 billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the Afghan rebels. This includes top-of-the-line, state-of-the-art anti-aircraft and anti-tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices. Nasty, nasty stuff.<br /><br />That this kind of multi-billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind Congressional doors is truly alarming. Every American should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business-as-usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government. Oh momma, I wish it weren't so...<br /><br />Even though the initial outcome for ""Team Charlie"" was an unqualified success, the unimaginable, unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the Taliban and others. Since the funding was entirely ""covert,"" the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of Soviet oppression and the end to Russian barbarity was the direct result of American intervention. Yes, once the Russkies left, so did our aid -- zip for schools, zip for infrastructure, zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the Afghan people. As a result, the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster -- it's like the forerunner to ""Mission Accomplished.""<br /><br />As Nichol's film so pointedly points out, ""The ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it."" Mike Krzyzewski knows this, Eva Longoria Parker knows this, little Lateesha in Lafayette knows this, but the typical American politician doesn't. So we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn't let the world know we were the good guys. Talk about a Catch-22 (another Mike Nichols film).<br /><br />Perhaps Charlie Wilson said it best, ""We f&%ked up the end game.""<br /><br />Again.",9.4,2007
179,Un Chien Andalou,"Surrealist, Experimental","I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this film by Bunuel (with some ideas from Dali) left me cold. Bunuel had a life-long grudge against the Catholic church and delighted in trying to offend Catholics in fairly silly ways. This is one of the silliest; almost like what you'd expect from a smart-aleck 18-year-old in film class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are a final nose-thumbing at religion.<br /><br />If you read the ""scholars"" regarding this slow-paced, occasionally amusing film, it's all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression. If that is indeed the point, then Bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible. The central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street, and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies. Is this behavior the church's fault (for interrupting his lovemaking), or is he just a jerk? I vote for the latter. I think Bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the Catholics as the ones to blame.<br /><br />There are a few moments where you might cry, ""Aha! surrealism!"": a cow in a bed, a giraffe falling out a window (a poor model), a man shredding a feather pillow, a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava (or a mud pit...hard to tell in B/W). The rest is forgettable self-indulgence. Unfortunately, Bunuel was still chasing the same bogey-men through the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Charm...). If you're interested in seeing surrealism on the screen, check out Jean Cocteau's early work.",2.3,1929
180,You're a Big Boy Now,"Drama, Comedy","This ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's ""hippie mentality"" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. Its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. A naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( Kay Lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (Holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in ""love"" with him. If you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. She keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. I couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. Its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. A disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, I had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. A corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. Avoid this if you can. Grade D.",3.5,1966

The plot was believable, and I love the message.

182,Rabbit Seasoning,"Animation, Comedy","Chuck Jones's 'Rabbit Seasoning', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I would have to concede that 'Rabbit Seasoning' is the most finely honed script. Here, the emphasis is placed on language as Bugs and Daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of Abbot and Costello's 'Who's on next' routine. As a long term Daffy fan, I have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the famous ""Pronoun trouble"" being one of the all time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while Elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer pose so little threat to Bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old Daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. It all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration ""You're despicable"". As intricate an example of Chuck Jones's impeccable timing as you'll come across, 'Rabbit Seasoning' is a true classic.",6.2,1952
183,Crossfire,Mystery,"""Crossfire"" is a justifiably famous 1947 noir that's a murder mystery with a strong message. It stars Robert Young, Robert Mitchum, Robert Ryan, Sam Levene, and Gloria Grahame, and is strongly directed by Edward Dmytryk. We witness the murder in shadow at the beginning, and for the rest of the film, Young, as the detective, Finlay, in charge of the case, seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death, and just as important, why. The victim, Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene) is someone the soldiers meet in a bar; they go up to his apartment to continue their visit, and Samuels winds up dead.<br /><br />I don't know about 1947, but seeing ""Crossfire"" today, one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects. I don't suppose it was so apparent back then, as these actors were just getting started. Nevertheless, the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting, good direction, violence, and unsparing anti-Semite language.<br /><br />The characterizations are vivid, including that of Gloria Grahame in a smallish role - she's a woman who meets Mitchell (George Cooper), one of the suspect soldiers, in a bar and can provide him with an alibi. The big performance in the film belongs to Robert Ryan, but everyone is excellent. Robert Young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective. Mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend Mitchell, a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife.<br /><br />Truly excellent, and a must see.",9,1947
